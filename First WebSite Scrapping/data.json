        "content": "In response to Arjuna\u2019s question about the difference between sanyaasa and tyaaga, renunciation and abandonment, Shri Krishna provided several contemporary definitions of tyaaga. He then enumerated three kinds of tyaaga based on the three gunaas. The foremost is sattvic tyaaga where the individual performs his duty and gives up attachment to any personal reward. The importance of action was reiterated for those who have a sense of ego, a sense of I and mine.   Next, Shri Krishna analyzed the five factors that are involved in any action : the foundation, the doer, the instruments, energy and divinity. He then analyzed the three factors that compel us to act : knowledge, action and the sense of doership. These three, as well as intellect, fortitude and joy, were each categorized as sattvic, raajasic and taamasic. This conclusively proved that no one or nothing is free from the effect of the three gunaas.   After explaining the power of the gunaas over our lives, the system of analyzing our mental makeup, the varna system, was explained. Self analysis of our mental makeup enables us to select our duty towards society, which is broadly classified as brahman, kshatriya, vaishya or shoodra. By engaging in our duty and offering our actions to Ishvara, we purify our mind of all selfishness, and reach the state of jnyaana nishthaa yogyata, qualification for devotion to knowledge. When seekers reaches this stage, they engage in a life of monkhood, enabling them to contemplate upon the nature of the aatmaa, the self, and remain devoted to that knowledge, which is known as jnyaana nishthaa, the final stage in the spiritual journey.   Knowing that the state of monkhood is quite far away for most seekers, Shri Krishna restates the teaching which is appropriate for most spiritual seekers. Seek Ishvara, surrender to Ishvara, take refuge in Ishvara, submit all actions and enjoyments to Ishvara. This will enable us to transcend the machine of maaya in which we are trapped. Through Ishvara\u2019s grace, we will make progress in our spiritual journey. The eighteenth chapter and the Gita concludes with Arjuna accepting Shri Krishna\u2019s teaching, Shri Krishna explaining the teaching tradition and praising the teacher and student who study the Gita, and Sanjaya praising and recollecting the joy of listening to the teaching."

Taken literally, we can see that Sanjaya wanted to very subtly inform Dhritraashtra that the Paandava army would be victorious, and that his sons, the Kauravas, would be annihilated. This was bound to happen because the world\u2019s foremost warrior, Arjuna, and Shri Krishna, the lord of all yogas, were on the opposing side of the Kauravas. There was not even a tiny chance that the Kauravas would win the war. This was the conclusive answer to the first line of the Gita, where Dhritraashtra wanted to know what did the Kauravas and Paandavas do on the battlefield.        From the standpoint of our duty, we can interpret this shloka as follows. Regardless of how much time and effort we put into any action, we cannot be assured of success. We saw earlier that the success of any action depends on a multitude of factors, but it boils down to two things: self effort and Ishvara\u2019s grace. If either aspect is missing, our actions will not be successful. Self effort or purushaartha alone cannot guarantee a result, neither can waiting for Ishvara\u2019s grace or prasaada without any effort from the part of the individual.         From the absolute standpoint, liberation from bondage, realization of our true self is not possible purely through self effort. We need to perform our duty selflessly, in a spirit of service to Ishvara, without any other person or object as our goal. Selfless devoted service to Ishvara, combined with Ishvara\u2019s grace, will result in progress and success in the spiritual journey. Without Ishvara\u2019s grace, it is not possible.        We end our journey through the Gita here.

He now refers to Arjuna as a mahaatmaa, since Arjuna had realized the nature of his true self. He refers to the conversation between Shri Krishna and Arjuna as adbhuta, which means fascinating, marvellous, wonderful. It made his hair stand on end, such was the level of his amazement. Although Sanjay had his own reasons for expressing his wonder, which we shall see now, from our standpoint, it is indeed fascinating that we are able to study the text that was created by ancient Rishis several thousand years ago. Furthermore, such knowledge is rare to find in this material obsessed world, that is what makes it even more fascinating.        One of the reasons for Sanjaya\u2019s excitement is that he was able to listen to the Gita live, in real-time, not second-hand. This was made possible by a divine boon granted to him by Sage Veda Vyaasa. This boon was previously offered to Dhritraashtra who refused it, since he did not want to witness the destruction of his sons. Sanjaya praises Sage Vyaasa for granting this boon to him. It enabled him to hear the teaching of the Gita, the ultimate manual of yoga, from the lord of all yogas himself, Shri Krishna. Yoga, in this context, refers to that which can unite the finite with the infinite.        Another benefit of the boon to Sanjaya was the ability to view the Vishwa roopa, Ishvara\u2019s cosmic form, exactly as seen by Arjuna. No one besides Arjuna ans Sanjaya were able to see this form. As we recall, this form invoked wonder and fear in Arjuna, who had a reputation of not getting afraid of anyone or anything. This form had such an impact on Sanjaya that he repeatedly recalled this form to memory, and rejoiced every time he recalled it. Sanjaya referred to the teaching as punyam, that which is sacred, that which purifies its listener."

Arjuna uses the same address, achyuta, the infallible one, in this shloka. So the conversation that was initiated by Arjuna is concluded here. Arjuna says that the ignorance of his true nature is no more, since he has regained his smritihi, his memory, the knowledge of his true self. When one comes to know about their true self, there is no more delusion in this world. Everything is seen for what it really is, an illusion, a superimposition by maaya on the self.         There is another significance of the word achyuta. While we forget our true nature, and erroneously take maaya to be real, Ishvara is always standing firm in his position as unaffected by the superimposition of maaya. Since he is infallible, only with his grace can we overcome our delusion and come out of the cycle of birth and death, of samsaara. Removal of delusion is the aim of all spiritual teaching, as we saw earlier. All that remains is to stand firm, to be stitaha, in the knowledge of our true self.         From the standpoint of the world, Arjuna was convinced that performing his duty as a warrior was the right decision to make at this point. Therefore, he acknowledged that the teaching of the Gita benefitted him, and that he was ready to fight in the war. From the highest standpoint of the absolute, Arjuna\u2019s sense of agency, his sense of doership, had gone away, once he understood that the self can neither do anything, nor can it enjoy anything. He performed actions spontaneously, in the service of Ishvara. In the words of Shri Shankaraachaarya, he had achieved the ultimate goal of life. He did not have to accomplish anything else."

Like someone who has multiple personality disorder needs treatment to understand who they really are, all of us need a qualified teacher who can impart the knowledge of the Upanishads to us so that we can regain the knowledge of our self.        Shri Krishna taught the Gita, which is also another Upanishad, so that Arjuna and other seekers in the future could annihilate their ignorance about their true nature as the self. He employed logic, reasoning, scriptural authority, emotion, psychology, every trick in the book to ensure that Arjuna could grasp the message of the Gita. Having done all that, he still wanted to give Arjuna the chance to ask any other doubts or questions with regards to the teaching. He also asked Arjuna whether he had listed with focus, or whether his mind was wandering."

He refers to the teaching using the words dharmyam samvaadam, which means a dialogue based on dharma. Most spiritual teachings in the Indian tradition are in the format of a dialogue between the student and the teacher, where the student is always given the opportunity to ask questions. Otherwise, the teaching becomes dogma. And the content of the conversation, the discussion of the eternal essence, makes it dharmyam, sacred.        Now, when a sincere student studies this conversation between Shri Krishna the teacher, and Arjuna the student, such a student gains the same insight and understanding that Arjuna would, provided he is qualified. When this happens, a sacrifice of knowledge, a jnyaana yajnya takes place. As we have seen in an earlier chapter, the sacrifice of knowledge is considered the foremost type of sacrifice that anyone can undertake. Study of the Gita, then, becomes the highest kind of sacrifice.        Why do we undertake yajnyas or sacrifices? It is to repay our debt to the elements, to our ancestors, to plants and animals, to our teachers, and to our fellow beings. We offer them our prayers, and also other material offerings such as clarified butter. But when we conduct a sacrifice of knowledge, we sacrifice our individuality, our finitude, so that we can merge into the infinite Ishvara. Such a sacrifice is beyond all notions of material offerings, and is conducted in solitude. So then, Shri Krishna asserts that the student of the Gita occupies the position equal to one who conducts the most supreme sacrifice. Furthermore, even one who may not sincerely study, one who may not have understood the deeper meaning, but would just have listened to the Gita, will benefit in some way or another."

He now describes the teacher who imparts this knowledge to society. He says that the foremost quality of the teacher is devotion to Ishvara, and only such a teacher can impart the real knowledge of the Gita to students, who are also devoted to Ishvara. The teacher should deliver the teaching in the spirit of karma yoga, in a spirit of service to Ishvara, not for name, fame or honour.        In return for their selfless service of teaching the Gita, Shri Krishna declares in no uncertain terms that the teacher will go to Ishvara, he will liberated from all sorrow. Praising the teacher, he says that there is no other person on this earth who does actions that are dearer than the action of teaching the Gita. He further says that the teacher becomes the dearest person Ishvara. It is a status so special that it spans the past, present and future. In other words, this special position transcends all time, such is its greatness.        Why does Ishvara love the teacher so much? The teacher assists Ishvara in the his mission to rid the world of ignorance. A teacher can assess the needs of the seeker, and give him the guidance from the Gita needed for that particular situation of the seeker. Only a qualified teacher is able to do that, as opposed to someone randomly reading shlokas from the Gita. Furthermore, very few people are able to teach the true meaning of the Gita, and convey to the student exactly what Ishvara wants to convey, without distorting anything."

There are rules with regards to how a teacher should be selected, how a student should be selected, what the teaching method should look like. We cannot read a serious text like we read a magazine or a newspaper, nor can we expect an undergraduate student of arts to solve a PhD level differential equation. Therefore, a serious study of the Gita should also follow certain guidelines and rules. Here, Shri Krishna enumerates these rules.         The Gita should not be taught to one who has not undergone a certain degree of penance or austerity. He should be willing to bear some physical discomfort while attending a discourse, for instance. It is clear that one who wants to visit the bar every night and follow it with a visit to the club will not gain any benefit from the Gita. A certain level of detachment from the material world is required. Secondly, the Gita should not be taught to someone who is not a devotee. If the student does not harbour respect for the guru, the teacher, he does not have the requisite level of humility to undertake spiritual inquiry.        The word shushrushaa has two meanings. It refers to one who has an attitude of service towards the world, instead of a highly selfish outlook. It also refers to one who is fond of listening to discourses. The Gita should not be taught to one who is highly selfish, nor to one who is not interested in listening to any kind of discourse. Finally, the Gita should not be taught to anyone who has objection to the notion that there is Ishvara, there is something beyond the material world. The Gita is not meant for purely materialistic individuals who are content with their existence."

This is because their boss may tell them to do one thing, but their boss\u2019s boss may tell them to do something else. The sales team may offer suggestions that are completely opposed to the marketing team\u2019s view. The new employee will be totally confused till they figure out a sort of compromise. But, if by chance, the new employee meets the CEO of the company and gets their opinion, they will have a clear and unambiguous direction.        It is said that this shloka, containing the sum and substance of the entire Gita, is the one \u201ctake home message\u201d for any student who feels bewildered or overwhelmed with the teaching. There are four parts to the shloka. The first part instructs the seeker to abandon all of their duties. Let us look at this deeper meaning since we should not take it literally. This means that Shri Krishna wants the seeker to stop analyzing which actions they should stop performing, which actions should they continue pursuing and which new actions should they take up. They should simply stop worrying about all these questions.        So then, what should the seeker do? The second part of the shloka gives the answer \u2013 take refuge in Ishvara alone. All our thoughts, words, actions, feelings, everything should be dedicated towards Ishvara. By doing so, we will automatically arrive at the answers to our questions regarding what to do and what not to do. If we eat our food by first offering it to Ishvara, we will automatically stop eating food that is not appropriate. If we offer all of our actions to Ishvara, we will not perform any illegal or unethical actions. Everything will automatically fall into place.        What is the result of taking refuge in Ishvara? The third part of the shloka assures the seeker that they will be liberated from all of their paapa, their sins. Sins in this context refers to the bondage of actions caused by our ego. If we perform all actions in service to Ishvara, and accept any success or failure as a gift from Ishvara, we will never harbour any worry or anxiety about the past or future. We will simple continue to fill our time in relentless service to Ishvara. Ultimately, we will reach a stage where our mind is purified of all selfishness, leading to the fourth part of the shloka, complete freedom from sorrow.         Shri Krishna ends this shloka with the words \u201cdo not grieve\u201d. It is said that the core teaching of the Gita is complete, since the teaching was begun with a view to eliminate the cause of Arjuna\u2019s sorrow, which is his ignorance of his true nature as the self."

The whole of the Gita comprises a comprehensive curriculum of spirituality. It is applicable for all kinds of seekers at all stages in their spiritual pursuit. A detailed study of the Gita requires several lifetimes. But, from a practical standpoint, is that aspect of the Gita that will benefit the majority of seekers who are stuck in the trappings of material world, not knowing how to take the first step. With this in mind, Shri Krishna provides a four point summary of the Gita.        The first point, and the main point, is that the seeker should fix their mind on Ishvara. How can this happen? The second point states that the seeker should become devoted to Ishvara. Devotion here means that the seeker\u2019s actions and speech should support the mind in its attempt to fix itself on Ishvara. This will only happen when the entire day is filled with worship of Ishvara through one\u2019s actions, which is the third point. If no actions are being performed, then the seeker can simply bow to Ishvara in reverence, which is the fourth point.        In the Srimad Bhaagavatam, when the great devotee Prahlad was asked by his father, the demon Hiranyakashipu, to reveal what he had learned in his school, Prahlad listed the nine fold aspects of bhakti, which is in line with this shloka. The nine forms of bhakti are hearing the name of Ishvara, repeating the name of Ishvara, remembering Ishvara, serving the feet of Isvhara, worshipping Ishvara, praising Ishvara, looking upon Ishvara as a master, treating Ishvara as a friend, and surrendering to Ishvara wholeheartedly."

A good teacher is one who can not only impart the knowledge, but also, extract the big ideas out of the complexity and present it to the student in such a manner that it can be easily grasped. There is no point teaching a complex subject which students memorize for the sake of passing the exam, but forget it as soon as they submit their paper. Shri Krishna wanted to convey the essence of the Gita to Arjuna, so he addressed him again, after having concluded the teaching.        The Gita is a formidable text to understand thoroughly. It deals with karma yoga, bhakti yoga, jnyaana yoga and raaja yoga. The same word is used differently in different contexts. For example, the word \u201caatmaa\u201d is used to mean body, mind, intellect and the self. The Gita makes references to individuals from Vedic and Puraanic literature which requires further effort on the part of the teacher and the student. Seekers who approach the end of the teaching will appreciate a teacher who will extract its essence.         Shri Krishna also expresses his motivation for summarizing the teaching. He does not want any reward from Arjuna in return for this teaching. Nor is he doing so out of fear of anyone or anything. He only has a lot of affection for Arjuna, he regards Arjuna as a staunch friend, and he also knows what is the right teaching for the situation Arjuna finds himself in. Therefore, he wants to impart the supreme statement, the param vachaha, the essence of the Gita, that will provide the most benefit to Arjuna."

Shri Krishna also emphasizes the most secret aspect of this text. We have to understand the implication of the word secret here carefully. The Gita is by no means an exclusive text. There are several commentaries, including this one, that are freely available on the web. Most people will not approach the Gita due to their preconceived notions. Some think it is outdated, some think it is impractical and so on. Only a few people are interested in the Gita, and of those, fewer still are willing to understand and change their approach to life based on it.        For any spiritual teaching to have an impact on our lives, it has to go through three steps. Shravana is actively listening to the text through a qualified teacher. Manana is reflection on the teaching, with a view to resolve all doubts or gaps in logic. Nidhidhyaasana is meditation and constant contemplation, with a view to assimilate that teaching completely. Many seekers are enthusiastic listeners, but they make the mistake of skipping the second step. In doing so, they are not able to see the value of the teaching in their own lives. Shri Krishna stresses the importance of reflection to Shri Krishna. He also gives Arjuna the freedom to apply the teaching based on this understanding born of out of reflection, instead of taking it at face value."

Her twins are playing in the hall. It is time for their next meal. One twin has learned how to walk before the other twin, and so, walks across the hall to drink his glass of milk. Frustrated at his efforts to walk, the second twin cries out to his mother. The mother immediately rushes to lift him up and give him his glass of milk. She knows that the first child does not need her help, but the second one does.         Shri Krishna says that for people who are still in stuck in the material world, who cannot renounce it in order to gain knowledge about the eternal essence, do have a shot at liberation. This can only happen by taking refuge in Ishvara. But this is no ordinary kind of refuge. It is sarve bhavena, it is wholehearted surrender, also known as sharanaagati. We cannot partially take refuge in Ishvara and also take refuge in material entities such as wealth, power and influence. We cannot hedge our bets in this manner. It has to be complete surrender to Ishvara.         So what is the result of sharanaagati? It is the grace, the prasaada, of Ishvara. It is like the mother automatically lifting the child, without any effort of the child. This grace removes all impurities from the mind, resulting in supreme peace, parama shaanti. We stop worrying about our food, clothing and shelter, since we realize it was always in the hands of Ishvara. We simply carry on performing our duty. In time, through the grace of Ishvara, the seeker attains the eternal abode, the shaashvata sthaanam of Ishvara, which is liberation from all sorrow."

Any person could participate in the video game as long as they were connected to the Internet. Players were placed in a virtual world where they could form teams with other players from across the world. Players would win points for shooting a member of the opposing team, and lose points if they would get shot. The creator of the Quake game had no influence on the outcome of the game, other than setting the rules of the game when it was created.         Shri Krishna says that the universe is like a gigantic video game set in motion by Ishvara. This video game is maayaa, also known as Prakriti, which is comprised of the three gunaas. By itself, maaya is insentient, it cannot do anything on its own. The eternal essence reflected in maaya adds sentience to maaya, it injects life into maaya by becoming the individual soul, the jeeva. In this way, each jeeva loses its connection with the eternal essence, and is stuck in this massive machine, this massive video game known as maaya.         So then, how can the jeeva liberate itself from this never ending video game of maaya? Does the jeeva have a chance? Is there any such thing as free will, or are we just slaves of maaya? The clue lies in the fact that maaya is subservient to Ishvara. If we only rely on maaya, if we only spend our lives attached to the material world, we will never have a chance at liberation. But if we direct our efforts towards knowing the true nature of Ishvara, towards contacting Ishvara, there may be a shot at liberation. Fortunately, he is not in some remote heaven, he is seated within us. How should we approach him? This is taken up next."

Bookies that are sentenced to prison start operating gambling dens inside the prison itself. Unethical businessmen who get elected into political office sell election seats to the highest bidder.        Shri Krishna continues to convince Arjuna that the decision to quit the war will not work. Arjuna is the perfect embodiment of a kshatriya, a warrior, possessing all the qualities listed earlier in the chapter. Quitting the war would temporarily have suppressed his fighter instinct, but only temporarily. In due course of time, the force of his vaasanaas, the force of his mental impressions would have impelled him to fight the war he had fled. Worse still, shutting off his fighter instincts through coercion would have driven him to insanity.         Arjuna would probably have been convinced about the need to fight the war, since it was clear that he could not walk away from fulfilling his duty, and that he could not forcefully choke his inherent warrior instincts. If we were to take this argument to its conclusion, it means that we are helpless under the influence of our natural tendencies. But there has to be way out of this, otherwise there is no scope for liberation. Shri Krishna answers this doubt through an illustration in the next shloka."

But he decided to deliver the discourse of the Gita instead, not just for Arjuna\u2019s benefit but for the benefit of all future seekers. Having done so, he now vehemently points out the flaw in Arjuna\u2019s decision. He says, in crystal clear language, that the decision to not fight is wrong. It is purely ego-driven, and not in line with Arjuna\u2019s duty as a warrior.        In our personal experience, we come across stories of children who were misfits in their families and communities simply because their prakriti, their nature, their samskaaraas, were completely different. A family of doctors cannot get along with their son because he wants to become a musician. A family of traders is upset because their daughter wants to join the government civil service. Such conflict is a cause of endless frustration for families across the board, and there is no easy solution, because it is hard to change one\u2019s mental makeup.        Why do parents want to foist its career path onto their children? It is purely due to ego. Parents have a strong sense of mine-ness with regards to their children. They prefer not to think of their children as independent entities. The egos of parents derive strength from this sense of mine-ness, and insist that they have the power to reshape the destiny of their children. Similarly, Arjuna also assumed that he could override his nature as a warrior, and become a monk. Shri Krishna reminded him that his inherent nature as a warrior would compel him to fight, and that he should reconsider his decision."

Having completed the Gita discourse, he wants to bring Arjuna back to solving his original dilemma, whether to fight in a battle against his kinsmen, or whether to flee the battlefield and live the life of a monk. In the first chapter, we saw that Arjuna had completely broken down due to this dilemma, and had accepted Shri Krishna as his teacher to resolve it. Furthermore, at several points in the Gita discourse, Arjuna had asked questions that indicated his desire to flee the battlefield, rather than fight.        As the discourse came to its conclusion, Shri Krishna wanted to clearly point out to Arjuna that observing his duty as a warrior was the solution to his dilemma. This also meant that he had to stop listening to his ego, and listen to Ishvara. In fact, he had to completely submit himself to Ishvara\u2019s will, by fixing his mind or chitta on Ishvara, and accepting the results of all actions as praasaada, a gift from Ishvara. Shri Krishna promised Arjuna that he will overcome all durguna, all challenges, if he performed his duty in this fashion.        However, like Arjuna, most of us harbour extremely strong egos, that have become hardened over the course of our life, and probably, of several lives. We have strong attachments, strong likes and dislikes that can cloud our thinking, just like strong attachment to family clouded Arjuna\u2019s thinking. Only a qualified teacher, a guru, can raise us from the level of ego-driven living, and guide us towards the path of selfless service. Following the command of the ego can only lead us to vinaasha or destruction in the form of entrenchment in the material world."

As we saw in the previous shloka, we need to continue performing our duty, and not to worry too much if we inadvertently perform a prohibited action, and to consider Ishvara as the one and only one aashraya, the ultimate refuge. How does this actually work in practice? A step by step approach towards karma yoga and bhakti yoga is enumerated in this shloka for the convenience of the seeker.        First, the seeker should fix Ishvara as his ultimate goal. This is mat paraha, one who is completely oriented towards Ishvara. Next, such a seeker should surrender all his actions to Ishvara. In the ninth chapter, Shri Krishna had said \u2013 whatever you do, whatever you consume, whatever you offer or donate, and whatever penance you perform, submit it to me. This is sarvakarmaani sanyasya. Nothing is done for selfish ends such as wealth, power, position, vanity and so on. All is done for Ishvara only.         Now, when the seeker faces challenges in life, he needs to have a method to deal with them. Equanimity is the answer. All actions are performed with full awareness and knowledge, as an offering to Ishvara. No action is perform haphazardly. Once the action is complete, the seeker should neither be attached to success, nor to failure. Such an attitude will only develop as a result of accepting every object, person or situation encountered in life as a gift or a praasada from Ishvara. This is buddhi yoga, as described in the second chapter."

Unless one gave up all actions, took up a life of a monk, lived in a secluded place and contemplated constantly upon the eternal essence, liberation is not possible. How many of us, who are currently quite entrenched in the world, can see ourselves taking up a path of monkhood? It is next to impossible. We may begin to think that the Gita is not for us.         Anticipating this frustration, Shri Krishna brought the discourse back to Arjuna\u2019s level, as it were. Arjuna, like us, was not in a state to renounce his actions and retire to a state of monkhood. Shri Krishna reassured Arjuna that liberation is absolutely possible for such people. It is because of one key point. Whether one continues to act in this world, or takes up renunciation, liberation is entirely up to the grace of Ishvara. We can make all the preparations we want to fall asleep, but ultimately, whether or not we fall asleep is not in our hands.         So then, having known this, Arjuna, who had temporarily given up hope of attaining the shaashvata avyaya padam, the eternal and imperishable state of liberation, regained his interest in the discourse. Shri Krishna now began winding up the entire Gita, by summarizing its key aspects from a very practical standpoint. The simple practical advice given here is to continue performing our duty, not to worry too much if we inadvertently perform a prohibited action, and to consider Ishvara as the one and only one aashraya, the ultimate refuge."

So far, the monk only had a conceptual understanding of Ishvara\u2019s true nature. But, when his devotion to Ishvara reached its peak, when his individuality has been destroyed, when he sees Ishvara as his own self and not someone standing outside of him, he understand what Ishvara is in his essence. When that happens, his identity merges with Ishvara\u2019s identity. He enters, he merges into Ishvara. Knowing Ishvara in essence and merging into Ishvara are the same.        So then, this is true jnyaana, true knowledge. Shri Shankaraachaarya describes this pure understanding of Ishvara as one without a second, absolute, awareness, birthless, ageless, immortal, fearless and deathless. This is the meaning of the word yaha, meaning who I am, in the shloka. The word yaavaan, what I am, refers to the differences in Ishvara creates by his upaadhis, by his maaya. The ability to arrive at this distinction is the culmination of the seeker\u2019s efforts towards chitta shuddi, towards purifying his mind.        Now, what is the connection here between devotion and knowledge, between bhakti and jnyaana? It is said that jnyaana is the fruit of bhakti. When bhakti ripes, jnyaana arises. Bhakti cleanses the mind of all its impurities, and consequently, removes the sense of separation or individuality between the seeker and the world. The seeker, having understood that his self and Ishvara\u2019s self are one and the same, having understood the \u201casi\u201d in \u201ctat tvam asi\u201d, \u201cyou are that\u201d, he merges into Ishvara.

The monk develops supreme devotion, paraa bhakti, towards Ishvara. As the monk decreases his involvement in the material world, makes his mind pure, his devotion towards Ishvara starts to increase. The culmination of this devotion is complete equanimity towards everyone and everything. He sees everyone\u2019s joy as his joy, and everyone\u2019s sorrow as his sorrow. He feels fulfilled in himself, therefore he has no desire for anything new, or no grief for anything that he does not have. Only joy remains.        From the standpoint of Vedanta, the first six chapters of the Gita covered the analysis of \u201ctvam\u201d, the individual. Starting with karma yoga, then the purification of mind, then the study of scriptures, followed by taking up renunciation of all actions or monkhood, the seeker comes to know himself as the pure self, as distinct from his body and mind, which are products of maaya. But so long as he sees even a tinge of difference between his self and the world, that tinge of difference will eventually bring back raaga and dvesha, like and dislike. Therefore, he also needs to conduct analysis on the \u201ctat\u201d, which is Ishvara.         Analysis of Ishvara, knowing Ishvara in essence, was the topic of the chapters seven to twelve in the Gita. The seeker realizes that Ishvara creates, supports and destroys the world, through his power known as maaya. Maaya has the power to cover the true nature of Ishvara, and project a world of dazzling name and form. But, by listing Ishvara\u2019s vibhootis, and by eventually describing his universal form, Shri Krishna informs the seeker that Ishvara also, like the self, is distinct from the universal body and the universal mind. All that the seeker needs to do is to see the oneness between his pure self and Ishvara\u2019s pure self, distinct from all effects of maaya."

Shri Krishna enumerates those traits in this shloka, beginning with ahankaara or egoism. Egoism refers to the notion of I-ness in anything that is in the realm of Prakriti. For most people, their body is their self. For some others, it is the intellect. Even if these are temporary, they will become obstacles in meditation. A similar obstacle is the sense of mine-ness or mamataa.        Kaama refers to desire and passion, and balam or force refers to power of desire and passion. If these is are not checked, then the mind will always rush towards some object or the other, and do so with an intensity that is hard to control. Darpam is arrogance, which makes one feel that he is above others, and therefore, can do whatever he wants. This will prevent the monk from following a strict regimen of meditation. Another obstacle in meditation is parigrah, the sense of possessing or hoarding things, which can distract the monk from pursuing his path.        Ultimately, when the monk has done his best to remove all notions of I and mine from his mind, ensured that his surroundings are calm and free of distractions, ensured that likes and dislikes are conquered, convinced himself that the world is nothing but a collection of names and forms, he gets the wonderful reward in the form of serenity or shaantihi. He recognizes his true self as the shuddha saakshi, the pure witness, free from identification from the mind or body. He is now ready for resting in, which is the same as becoming, the eternal essence, brahman."

He says that such a monk like places that are vivikta, meaning isolated, solitary, away from the hustle and bustle of daily life. Such places are conducive for contemplation, since they do not have too many distractions. He is also laghvaashee, eating only the quantity of nutritious food necessary to sustain the body. Eating heavy meals causes drowsiness in the short term, and health problems in the long term.        Now even if the mind is placed in quiet surroundings, it will generate thoughts that will eventually result in actions of the body, or in speech. By regulating physical actions and speech, the monk will be able to regulate his mind as well. The end result of all this regulation is two fold. He will be able to fix his mind on the self, which is dhyaana, and will be able to contemplate upon the nature of the self, which is yoga. The nature of the self was expounded in the second chapter to be infinite, indestructible and so on.        The quality of dispassion or vairagyam comes up again in this shloka. In the last shloka, it was implicitly mentioned as absence of raaha and dvesha, like and dislike. The level of vairagya cultivated by the monk, however, is much greater than that which is harboured by seekers in early stages of spiritual practice. The monk has rid himself of even a tinge of belief that there is any real happiness to be found in the material world. He is samupaashritaha, fully possessed of the conviction that the self alone is worth pursuing, nothing else."

The urge to perform a lot of physical actions is low for such a person, otherwise it is impossible for him to even enter a monastic life. Now, the focus shifts towards regulating the mind. Since the monk has already eliminated his strongest material desires, he has to focus on the ones that are weaker, with a view of completely eradicating them as well.         Such a sanyaasi has a buddhi or intellect which is vishuddha, extremely pure, free from any doubts and misconceptions about the nature of the material world. There is not even a trace of doubt about the existence of joy in inert objects. His dhriti or fortitude is saattvic, as we have seen earlier in the section on fortitude. He has complete mastery over his mind. He is able regulate his mind by his intellect, and prevent it from wandering into materialistic thoughts. Even if that does happen, his vision prevents those thoughts from causing desire. How is he able to do that?          This world is nothing but names and forms, and forms are comprised of five elements \u2013 space, air, fire, water and earth. Shabda adeen in this verse refers to these five elements. The sanyaasi is able to look at any object or person, see through the name and form, and understand that it is nothing but the five elements combined together. Realizing that any combination of these elements is nothing but Prakriti or matter, he is able to eliminate any sense of raaga or dvesha, like or dislike, towards that object or person."

Besides doing the bare minimum needed to maintain the body, the monk is engaged in one and only one thing \u2013 constant contemplation, constant abidance upon the self.         For most of us, just contemplating on the self may seem a bit odd. How can such a seemingly mundane engagement result in liberation? So we need to remember that the self is already attained, there is no work that is needed to attain it. The only work that we have to do is to get rid of what is the no-self, in other words, purify our mind through karma and bhakti. Shri Krishna emphasizes this point by using the word nibodha, which means to know. There is nothing else that needs to be done in sanyaasa since it is the last stage of yoga."

Similarly, when we perform our duty observing the tenets of karma yoga, we will eventually reach a point where we are ready to move onto the next stage in the spiritual journey known as sanyaasa. The aashrama system in Indian culture appoints sanyaasa as the last aashrama, the last stage in life, where the individual should renounce all their duties and life a lifestle of a sanyaasi, a monk.        Shri Krishna lists three characteristics of a person who has reached the stage of sanyaasa or monkhood. His intellect is asakta, it is unattached from all objects, people and situations. It no longer entertains the notions that this object is mine, or this person is my daughter and so on. He is able to do so because he is jitaatmaa, he has fully conquered his mind, it does not get agitated or excited by external stimuli. And even without external stimuli, it does not feel the need to act in the world, because it is devoid of sprihaa or desires.        Arjuna wanted to know the difference between tyaaga and sanyaasa at the beginning of this chapter. We can glean the primary difference from the teaching so far. The end goal of tyaaga or karma yoga is purity of mind, also known as sattva shuddhi. The end goal of sanyaasa is the attainment of brahman or the eternal essence. It is also known as naishkarmya siddhi, the state, the accomplishment where one becomes actionless, or all actions become totally spontaneous, like a river entering the ocean. There are no more internal cravings or external goals since one has completely transcended the effect of the three gunaas."

Either we know such people as friends or co-workers, or we may be one ourselves. Perfectionism is a recipe for constant sorrow, because no matter who performs the actions, they will never be perfect. As we have seen earlier, an action is based on several factors, including the mental state of the performer, the instruments used, the state of the outside world and so on. It is next to impossible to expect all these factors to line up in such a manner that the action and its result will be perfect.        Shri Krishna says that any undertaking, any project, any action will always have some imperfection built into it, just like any fire will have some smoke covering it. So there is no point giving up our actions and our duties because they contain some imperfection or the other. Even the human body, the most intricate organism on this earth, has some minor defect in one form or the other, in the form of ill health or deformity and so on. Therefore, we have to accept this fact and continue to perform our best actions, not focus too much on the result.        With this shloka, the topic of karma yoga is concluded. If we recall, this topic was prompted by Arjuna in the beginning of this chapter, when he wanted to know the difference between sanyaasa and tyaaga. Tyaaga was redefined by Shri Krishna to mean karma yoga, and was analyzed in great detail. Tyaaga or karma yoga, combined with bhakti, is a process, is a means to get us to a destination. When practised properly, it lifts us from our materialistic life and places us on the path towards liberation. So then, if tyaaga is the means, what is the goal? This is taken up next."

As we saw earlier, our duty can only be understood by conducting self analysis to understand what our mental makeup, what our varna is. Some of us may be well suited for starting businesses, whereas some of us may be better suited for the service sector. But it is quite common to get enchanted by another person\u2019s occupation since it generates more money, since it has glamour and fame, and so on. How should we deal with this situation?        Shri Krishna says that we should stick to performing our svadharma, no matter how profitable or how glamourous other occupations seem like. In the short term, if we pick up another occupation, it may seem like we are doing a great job. But in the long run, we will fall into trouble. We will run into some problem or the other on account of not being suitable for someone else\u2019s occupation. We also will deprive society from giving it the level of service possible if we had stuck with what we are good at.         Harbouring likes and dislikes towards actions, preferring someone else\u2019s occupation to ours, has the effect of strengthening the ego, and hence should be avoided. Furthermore, in karma yoga, we are only expected to perform our best actions, and to not worry about the result. By performing our svadharma, by doing the best we can, we automatically the fear of the consequence of our action, whether or not it will be a merit or a sin. To perform actions fearlessly is a blessing in itself."

Only then does it result in the samsiddhi, the foremost accomplishment, the perfection that was spoken of earlier. Otherwise, mere performance of our duty will result in merits and demerits, paapa and punya, which will further trap us in the cycle of samsaara. We have to inject bhakti or devotion to Ishvara into all our actions. In other words, karma yoga and bhakti yoga need to go together. Performance of duty with devotion to Ishvara reduces the ego, the gigantic bundle of likes, dislikes and fears which is an obstacle to liberation.        Even in our daily lives, actions performed with devotion to someone or something have a different kind of feeling. They allow us to channel energy that we never thought we had. A mother will work tirelessly, day and night, for the benefit of her children. Freedom fighters gave their lives for the service of the nation. Offering actions to Ishvara, however, has the effect of reducing the sense of enjoyership, the bhokta bhaava, the pursuit of actions driven by likes and dislikes. Selfless service reduces the sense of kartaa bhaava, the notion that the I has to perform an action to remove some incompleteness. We become instruments of Ishvara\u2019s will, so there is no room for personal will.         Now, who is this Ishvara? He is the source, the origin of all beings, the intelligence cause, like the potter of a clay pot. He is also the material cause, the stuff by which everything is created, like the clay in a clay pot. When we offer our actions to the creator and sustainer of the universe, we lose all fear of the future, since we accept whatever comes our way as a prasaada, a gift from Ishvara. So there is no personal will, there is no personal preference, there is no fear. Doership, likes, dislikes and fears are nothing but the ego. It then, slowly withers away through karma yoga."

The net result of punyas and paapas decided the fate of every individual. One would gain a life that was better or worse than the current one based on their actions.        But there is more to the performance of duty than the cycle of action, reaction and rebirth. Shri Krishna says that performance of duty can become the gateway towards liberation. As we have seen earlier, the Gita enables each and every individual, regardless of their occupation or stage in life, to pursue the path of liberation. We do not have to renounce our actions and become sadhus or monks. We just have to keep doing our duty. The result of doing our duty is samsiddhi, perfection, the foremost accomplishment.        The ultimate goal of karma yoga is purification of the mind. It cleans the mind of all its impurities in the form of selfish desires created by raaga and dvesha, likes and dislikes. It is this purification of the mind that becomes the foremost accomplishment, samsiddhi, for one who is performing karma yoga. But mere performance of duty will not result in samsiddhi.

The mental makeup of vaishyas prods them to raise, invest and trade in capital, goods and services. Although the shloka mentions agriculture, cattle rearing and trade, the broader concern of vaishyas is money. They are guided by the economic motive behind all their actions. Vaishyas play a critical role in any society by starting and maintaining the engine of the economy. They ensure that the needs of society are met by providing what it needs at the right place, time and for the right price.        Shoodras comprise the service sector. They pursue occupations where they can serve society in an individual capacity. They have a lower tolerance for risk as compared to kshatriyas and vaishyas, since the proportion of rajas is lower. Therefore, they prefer to work in occupations where they render their services to society and in return, are compensated for their services appropriately. Like any other varna, their natural inclination to do a certain type of work is enhanced by gaining the right skills and training needed to perform their tasks well.         We should refrain from harbouring any notion that one varna is better than the other. The human body itself is said to be made up of four varnas. The mind is a braahmana, the hands are kshatriyas, the thighs are vaishyas and the legs are shoodras. The body cannot function properly if any component is malfunctioning. Similarly, society cannot function when one varna does not perform its natural duties. Societies that encourage each individual to realize their full potential tend to flourish. With this shloka, Shri Krishna concludes the description of the four varnas."

Therefore, in any society, we need capable people who have the mental makeup and skill set to perform these administrative and leadership functions. One who has the mental makeup to lead, administer and defend, is called a kshatriya.        Shri Krishna lists the qualities of a kshatriya in this shloka. Shauryam or valour is the courage needed to fight a war. Tejaha refers to fearlessness or boldness in the face of an enemry. Dhritihi or fortitude is the ability to hold on to one\u2019s mission in spite of physical and mental obstacles. Daakshyam is skillfulness or resourcefulness that enables one to think on one\u2019s feet and get the job done. Apalaayanam literally means not turning the back on one\u2019s enemy. All these qualities are needed in a capable soldier or commander.        Kshatriya also refers to administrators, bureaucrats and politicians. Daanam or charity is the ability to remove any sense of personal attachment to wealth, such that it can be deployed for the welfare of the community. Ishvara bhaava refers to the ability to rule or to exert one\u2019s authority upon a set of people in the same benevolent way that God does. It appears that such qualities are quite lacking in today\u2019s kshatriyas. In any case, kshatriyas have a predominance of rajas, followed by a moderate degree of sattva."

Restraint of mind and senses is seen in actions of braahmans. They never get agitated or perturbed even in the worst of situations. They have an immense capacity to bear and withstand these situations, which comes from leading a life of austerity and penance. Their mind is pure since it does not entertain thoughts of selfishness or hatred. Any mental or physical harm caused by someone else is instantly forgiven. They are extremely straightforward in their dealings with the world, since their mind, speech and actions are in line with each other.         Every action performed by a braahmana comes out of knowledge and discrimination. They never perform actions thoughtlessly or carelessly. This knowledge is not purely academic, it becomes wisdom due to the braahman\u2019s ability to apply it to practical situations. Braahmanas also have faith in the teachings of the scriptures, regardless of whether they have learned formally, or have first hand experience of those teachings. Broadly, all these characteristics are the product of a high degree of sattva in the mind, and only a tinge of rajas and tamas."

Now we have seen that high levels of rajas and tamas can bring our downfall. But we cannot sit at home by ourselves, fearful of their impact. We have to engage with the world, transact with society. What should we do?        Shri Krishna says that we first need to understand our mental makeup. Once we have studied and analyzed our mental makeup, we can channel our inherent tendencies into productive actions that contribute to the well being society. If we perform our duty to society, society will ensure that we live a healthy life and prosperous life. After all, society is nothing but a larger manifestation of Ishvara. This the best and most practical career counseling advice given to us in the Gita.        So this section of shlokas educates us about analyzing our internal proportion of gunaas. This system of classification and analyzis is known as the varna system. We have to remind ourselves again to remove all prior conceptions and connotations of varna, which is improperly translated or construed as caste. The caste system as it stands today is not what was envisioned by the Vedas. The analysis of gunaas to understand one\u2019s varna or one\u2019s sphere of activity has to come from within. It cannot be imposed by anyone from the outside."

The chapter began with Arjuna asking Shri Krishna about the difference between sanyaasa and tyaaga. Shri Krishna did not answer this question directly, but addressed the topic of karma yoga, which is the same as tyaaga. He ended this topic by declaring that the consequence or the fruit of action binds those who are attached to personal reward, and does not bind to those who are not attached. Next, he analyzed knowledge, action, agent, intellect, fortitude and happiness with the framework of the three gunaas, which is concluded with this shloka.        Shri Krishna summarizes this analysis by proclaiming the dominion of the three gunaas. He says that there is no being, object or entity, living or inert, that is beyond the influence of the gunaas. The gunaas work throughout the universe, and not just in a certain part of it, like the earth. We may be tempted to take this proclamation in a negative sense by accepting that there is no escape from the grip of Prakriti, no liberation. But that is not the case. The proclamation is meant to reinforce one of the central messages of the Gita, which is that Prakriti by itself is not the problem, it is our identification with Prakriti that is the problem we need to tackle.        The nature of this predicament was referenced in the fifteenth chapter through the illustration of the upside down tree which comprises the three gunaas. Only through the axe of detachment can this tree be destroyed. But, given that everything ultimately is under the influence of Prakriti, how can such a weapon be obtained? How can the identification with Prakriti be ended? Before this fundamental question is taken up, Shri Krishna spends a few shlokas on another preparatory topic next."

They derive joy, happiness and a sense of pleasure in these things, even if they know that they will lead to social, physical and mental ruin in the long run. Such a kind of joy is called taamasic sukha.        Shri Krishna says that such people are in moha. They are deluded into thinking that the state of stupor, created by indulging in excessive sleep, laziness and intoxication, is happiness. In other words, there is some sensation of joy which has to be acknowledged, but it is unwanted and destructive. Worse still, this perverse type of joy remains throughout the beginning, middle and end of the action. A lazy person will remain comfortably situated in his stupor throughout the day, and continue in his stupor through sleep in the night.        If we examine our lives, we may see that there are a few moments where we may sink into partaking taamasic joy. It is next to impossible to come out of this state once we are in it. Once someone has had a high quantity of alcohol, for instance, there is no way for them to recover. They just have to wait for it to leave the body naturally. Short of keeping a high level of awareness towards what we eat, drink, watch and think about, there is no clear antidote for taamasic joy."

It is hard to imagine a situation, except deep sleep, where we are not exposed to some sensory indulgence.        What is behind all of this? Sensory excitement is mistaken for joy in our world. Shri Krishna says that such sensory indulgence generates some temporary excitement in the beginning, but results in fatigue, or worse still, ill health, in the end. In his commentary, Shri Shankaraachaarya describes the effects of sensory indulgence. It leads to decline in strength, vitality, colour, wisdom, intellect, memory, wealth and most importantly, energy. Whenever there is sense contact beyond what is needed to sustain the body, our energy reserves are depleted.         Therefore, we need to stop giving such a lot of importance to sense objects and sense indulgence. The body will have a biological urge such as thirst, which can easily be quenched by water. But our mind craves for a soft drink instead of water, because it has associated the idea of joy with that soft drink. Such superimposition of joy on inert objects is called shobhana adhyaasa. Whenever such thoughts arise, we should counter them with sattvic thoughts of good health, fitness and wellness."

Fear is also caused by the anticipation of this pain. But we all know that any vaccination is given to us for our own long term benefit. It will prevent us from catching all kinds of diseases that can cripple us or even kill us.        So therefore, the reward for bearing pain is extremely beneficial to us. Shri Krishna says that sattvic joy is similar, in that when we first begin to experience it, it is quite unpleasant, but in the end, it is as pleasant as nectar. No spiritual path is easy to take up in the beginning. In karma yoga, one has to work selflessly, chipping away at the ego. The leap of faith needed for bhakti is difficult for people who have grown up doubting everything. Jnyaana yoga requires a high degree of awareness, whereas most of us lead automated robotic lives where someone else has done out thinking for us.        All of these practices have their goal as the purification of the mind, and of removing its three main doshas or faults: mala or selfish desire, vikshepa or lack of focus, and avarana or ignorance. Unless these three faults are diminished to a great extent, we will be unable to comprehend the nature of sattvic joy. This is unlike any joy we know so far, because it does not depend on any external factors such as objects, people or situations. It comes from inside, from the intellect that has turned inward towards the self."

The lifecycle of an action begins with Vaasanaas. These Vaasanaas or deep rooted impressions create thoughts, some of these thoughts become desires, and consequently, desires become actions. When the action is complete and the target of the action is attained, the desire subsides, and the mind is free of desires for a split second. This stillness of the mind results in joy.        Shri Krishna says that even this joy obtained as the result of an action is in the realm of Prakrirti. Any by product of an action is in the realm of Prakriti since actions themselves are in Prakriti. So therefore, this joy can also be classified into three types, which are saattvic, raajasic and taamasic. This also mean that the type of joy obtained is closely related to the knowledge, doer and action behind obtaining that joy. A taamasic action will not result in saattvic joy.        Shri Krishna also adds that the complete end of sorrow is only obtained through saattvic joy. This is because the other two types of joy, raajasic and taamasic, are mixed and impure respectively. They either have a tinge of sattva, or none at all. Furthermore, saattvic joy is such that having tasted it even a little bit, one becomes so attracted to it that one delights in performing actions that result in sattvic joy. That is why, saattvic joy is described in detail in the next shloka."

From the start of a task to its end, our intellect is confronted with a barrage of thoughts. If it drops the thought of completing the task and starts holding on to other tasks, it will never be able to take the task to its conclusion. Sattvic fortitude is active for all tasks, raajasic fortitude is active only for tasks motivated by selfishness and sense enjoyment. The third kind of dhriti or fortitude, one which holds on to everything but the task at hand, is taamasic.        While performing any task, it is natural to expect obstacles, and some fear as well. There are moments when our body and mind is tired, and we need to take some rest. If some things do not go as planned, we feel sorrow. If things do not go as planned repeatedly, we may also feel depressed or dejected. Conversely, if we experience some temporary successes, we may get intoxicated with the mental high, with the pride generated by those successes. Shri Krishna says that the fortitude that drops the thought of completing the task and holds on to any of these temporary thoughts is taamasic.        What causes someone to develop such a negative kind of fortitude? It is the degree of discrimination inherent in the intellect. One with a moderate level of discrimination has raajasic fortitude. But one in which there is little to no discrimination has no clue that he is choosing to hold on to thoughts that will ultimately lead him to ruin. Or to put it another way, one who has perversely high level of attachment to a certain object, person or situation will lose whatever level of discrimination he has left, due to the pursuit of that object of desire."

Over time, the importance and even awareness of liberation as a goal was lost. Most of us pursue the first three goals only. Shri Krishna says that the fortitude or the will power that enables us to pursue these three goals is termed as raajasic dhriti, raajasic fortitude. It is termed raajasic because it is oriented around the attainment of the goal, and also, the personal reward that comes to us when that goal is accomplished.        On college campuses, we always know of a few people that spend the entire day in the canteen, and do not attend even a single class. But somehow, many of them study for a few days prior to their exams, just enough so that they pass their tests. Some of them get very good at playing the guitar so that they can impress others. Yet others are spending their time buying and selling shares online. In all these cases, they seem to have a will power that only works when there is an occasion for pwesonal reward that is in line with their world view, their raajasic jnyaanam. The will power, the fortitude does not work all the time, especially for anything selfless or altruistic.        Another way to look at fortitude is to assess the type of thoughts that our intellect holds on to, and the type of thoughts it rejects. In the prior example, all three types of students know that a lecture is going on daily. Such a thought will arise in their mind every day, like it arises for every other student in the campus. However, the intellect chooses not to act upon that thought, and conequently, no action follows from a discarded thought. Instead, thoughts about sensual pleasure and accumulation of wealth are held on to, and are acted upon. Everything happens at the level of the mind and the intellect, and that is why the mind is given so much importance in the Gita."

First we looked at jnyaanam or knowledge, followed by karma or the action itself, the doer or kartaa, and buddhi or intellect. We also saw that jnyaanam gives us a target or a goal to act upon, and the intellect creates a plan to attain the goal. Now fortitude, another aspect of action, is examined in three shlokas, and is classified in the same manner as the other aspects of action.        Fortitude is an essential quality of the intellect which is useful in both material and spiritual endeavours. A seemingly simple action like going to the market to buy fruits requires a certain degree of fortitude. Some people will finish that task within no time. Some people will start heading to the market, but get distracted and go to a restaurant instead. Some other people may not want to get up from the bed, and in doing so, either procrastinate or forget the task entirely.        Shri Krishna says that the fortitude which is able to focus the mind on the task at hand, and also, is able to restrain the mind, energy and senses from straying away from the task, is saattvic. The task will be conducive to liberation, since it has been prompted by sattvic knowledge. The key quality of such fortitude is that it is avyabhichaarini, which means never wandering, never wavering, never flitting from one thing to another. Ultimately, we have to learn how to master our mind by mastering our thoughts.        Now, such immense fortitude can only be accomplished through yoga, which refers to the consistent, repeated practice of keeping our mind engaged in the self. Such strength can only be gained by daily studying of scriptures, daily worship of our deity, maintaining a good diet and so on. If we cannot even restrain our senses for dietary reasons, we will never be able to get to a state where the mind is constantly engaged in the self."

One room is cleaned and dusted daily, so the bulb light shines brightly. All objects  in this room are seen crystal clear. The second room is cleaned once every month, so the light from the bulb is partially covered by dust. Some objects in the room are seen clearly, but some are fuzzy. The third room has not been cleaned for several years, so the bulb delivers hardly any light at all, since it has acquired a thick coating of dust and dirt on it. We can barely see any object in this room.        Similarly, our intellect, which is like a light bulb, gets covered by the dirt of selfish desires. A raajasic intellect is like the bulb in the second room, with partially obscured light. But the taamasic intellect is like the bulb in the third room. The level of selfish desires is so great that the intellect cannot shine through. Shri Krishna says that such a such a person behaves in a totally ignorant and illogical fashion, confusing what is right with what is wrong. Vipareeta, the word used to describe such an intellect, means topsy turvy, contrary, reverse.        Where did such a high degree of selfishness come from? It is nothing but a bundle of vaasanaas, impressions that have been gathered since birth, or even through several lifetimes. It starts with the taamasic jnyaanam, the knowledge or worldview, that presents one object, person or situation as the sole goal of attainment, to the exclusion of everything else. It says, \u201cmoney is the sole aim of life, everything else is secondary\u201d. So the intellect responds : \u201clet\u2019s rob someone to get this money\u201d, and in doing so, going against all logic, morality, ethics and civility. Each time such an action is committed, its strengthens the vaasanaa for stealing and harming people. Over time, a thick cloud of these harmful vaasanaas coat the intellect."

Unless such knowledge is gained through a competent teacher, and years of one\u2019s life are put in, the quality of our work output will never reach perfection.        Shri Krishna says that the science of action, the karma yoga, needs to be studied with similar dedication and guidance. Unless we learn what is our dharma, what is our duty towards this world, we will be swimming in an ocean of ignorance. Are our actions ethical? Are they carried out for selfish ends or are they performed selflessly? Are they entangling us further in worldly affairs, or are they taking us closer to liberation? We need to understand karma yoga, the science of action, to clearly understand all this.        Therefore, one who has not received this knowledge will always be unclear about what is dharma and what is not. Consequently, they will always be confused whether to act or not. Confusion will creep in if we forget our dharma and get swayed by egoism and attachment. Arjuna\u2019s attachment to his family members, the Kauravas, triggered this confusion with regards to his duty as a warrior. Shri Krishna had to teach him the science of karma yoga to remove this confusion. So then, whenever our intellect gets confused about whether to act or not, we can assume that it is raajasic, tinged with selfishness."

Now it is upto our buddhi, our intellect, to decide the course of action. Typically, for any objectve, we need to decide whether or not we want pursue the objective, and if we do, how should we go about doing it. Shri Krishna says that a saattvic intellect, a saattvic buddhi is one that is clear on those two factors. In fact, Shri Krishna breaks the two factors down into four assessments: assessing one\u2019s stage in life and one\u2019s svadharma first, then whether an action is one\u2019s duty or not, then whether to be fearful or not, and lastly, whether to continue to act or not.        As we will see in a later topic in this chapter, the varna aashrama system, the system of aptitude and stage of life, helps us determine whether we should act at all, and if so, which actions should we perform and which we should not. A student should focus on studying, not in creating a family. A soldier should focus on protecting his country, not making money by selling his country out. The varna aashrama system helps address the first two assessments: engagement and withdrawal, and what is our duty and what is not. For example, if we get a new business proposal, we should assess whether we have the aptitude to execute it, but also, whether we are in the right stage of life. It is no use starting a new business when we are in our late sixties.        Once the varna aashrama system has approved the performance of an action, we need to test whether the action is motivated by personal reward, or whether it is motivated by selfless service. If we have fear in our mind while performing an action, chances are that a trace of egoism has crept into it. We may be doing the action out of the need for praise and honour. But if our mind is fearless, we can assume that our action is motivated out of selflessness. Lastly, as we perform one action after another, we should always examine whether these actions are taking us closer to liberation, or are further entrenching us in the material world. An intellect that guides us in such a manner is termed saattvic."

Jnyaanam or knowledge prompts an individual to perform an action. The kartaa or doer is the state of mind while performing the action. Now, although the knowledge or jnyaanam aspect supplies the doer with the target of action, it does not prescribe a plan of action as to how to get that object. Therefore, the buddhi, the intellect, gives the course of action.        Once the intellect has determined the course of action, the doer needs to hold on to that course of action, and not arbitrarily get distracted or change its tactics. The quality of holding on to something in spite of obstacles is known as dhriti or fortitude. Shri Krishna says that intellect and fortitude are part of Prakriti\u2019s gunaas. So they also are divided into three types. He proceeds to describe them in the next six shlokas. He also emphasizes that he will give a complete description, without leaving anything out.        So then, jnyaanam is the goal, buddhi is the plan and dhriti is adherence to the plan. Even in our daily life we see that different people can get the same outcome through different plans. And some people fail in face of obstacles, while some people persevere. Some people see a roadblock as an opportunity to think outside the box, whereas some people are completely flummoxed. Understanding how to plan and how to stick to the plan has benefits in the material path as well as the spiritual."

It is the longest list of the three types of doers. Even if we will take a long time to cultivate saattvic qualities, it is fine. But we should strive to reduce, and eventually eliminate, any trace of these taamasic characteristics within us. Forget holding us back on the spiritual path, these qualities will become a detriment even to success in our material world.         If the state of mind is taamasic while performing a task, the mind will be ayukta or unsteady. It will never be able to focus on one thing, and will jump from thought to thought, or from distraction to distraction. Praakrita, opposite of samskrita, refers to a mind that is uncultured, uncouth, without proper values or the ability to think logically. Taamasic doership comes from taamasic vision, which always hangs on, perversely, to one particular object, viewpoint, person or situation. Therefore, the mind becomes stabdha, unyielding, arrogant, unwilling to accept a different position.        Now, some more dangerous characteristics are presented. A taamasic mind will not step at anything to accomplish its task. It will be shataha, which means malicious, deceptive, fradulent, playing games rather than being straightforward. This type of mind will also resort to creating a negative environment for others. It will be naishkritaha, which means wicked. Conversely, if the task is not upto its liking the mind will be alasaha or lazy. It will always remain in a state of vishaada, which means forever dejected, despondent and depressed. It will find ways to pawn the task off to someone else by procrastinating. A somewhat funny word is used to describe this characteristic \u2013 deerghasootree which means long string or long length. Shri Shankaraachaarya says in his commentary that such a person will take months to do a one day task."

For most of us, this is our normal or default state of mind whenever we perform any action. Raaga refers to likes, and also to its opposite factors, dvesha or dislikes. Our mind rushes out into the world towards a certain set of objects, people and situations that it likes, and also, runs away from other objects that it dislikes. This creates additional friction while performing action. For instance, if we have to deal with people that our mind dislikes, we will not be able to get the job done efficiently.        A raajasic doer is always thinking \u2013 what is in it for me? This thought of coveting the reward of action shifts our attention away from the action, and consequently, losing focus from the action. Our motives are impure, since they are selfish. Once we get a personal reward, we want more like it, we become greedy. We sometimes do not hesitate to harm others who come in the way of our personal reward, we can become quite cruel towards them. We are also prone to elation and depression whenever there are temporary wins or setbacks in performing our actions.        Such a doer is termed raajasic. The raajasic doer is prompted to act by raajasic vision, which cuts up the world into pieces and attaches likes and dislikes to those pieces, as opposed to saattvic vision that presents a unified, harmonious view of the world. The foundation of a raajasic doer is the notion of attachment to the reward, the action, and to the sense of individuality or I. This stands in total contrast to the saattvic doer. The only way we can rise from our present state to a saattvic state, is by reducing our attachment to the world, and increasing our attachment to Ishvara."

Jnyaana or knowledge shapes our world view and prompts our actions. It is a product of Prakriti and is of three types. Karma or action itself is also of three types. Now, Shri Krishna starts a new topic and describes three types of the kartaa, the doer. The doer is nothing but the state of our mind from the start of an action to its end. In other words, the same action can be performed differently by different types of doer. We see this in our lives as well. No two people will perform a task in quite the same way.        This shloka describes a doer who is of the nature of sattva, of is sattvic. Shri Krishna says that a saattvic doer is prepared for any outcome of the action, be it success or failure. They will not let external circumstances change their state of mind. If the action fails, they do not dwell on it but learn from their mistakes and move on. Many top athletes have this quality, since they have to continually compete throughout their career, and cannot afford to get depressed or elated with each outcome.        In addition to success or failure, we also encounter temporary setbacks during the action. A sattvic doer possess extreme endurance to deal with these setbacks. Their enthusiasm to do their duty lifts them out of any temporary sense of sorrow. In the second chapter, Shri Krishna had emphasized the importance of fortitude, also known as titikshaa. Their utsaaha, their enthusiasm makes them stronger since they are not perturbed by outcome. They are also not concerned about egoism, about tooting their horn in front of others, since they are unconcerned about how good or bad they will look in front of others.        Freedom from attachment of any kind is the crucial quality of the saattvic doer. They are not attached to the outcome of the action, to the action itself, or to their sense of individuality, their ego. They have achieved a high level of vairagyaa, of dispassion from the pulls of the material world."

As an example, a lot of new college graduates start a career path just because they get a lot of money, but they do not fully learn about the impact on their health, whether there is any ethical compromising going on etc. They also do not stop to think whether they have the aptitude, capability, training and passion for their role. Whenever we begin any action without fully understanding its impacts and consequences, that action becomes taamasic.        On similar lines, many people invest money in new ventures without having done the due diligence on the business plan, understanding the market and so on. They do not take into account the potential loss of their investment, since they only focus on the potential game. Furthermore, they do not assess whether their new venture could harm the economic, political or natural environment. Even if they know what the harm is, they conveniently choose to overlook those facts. Such kind of action is also called taamasic action.        The root of taamasic action is taamasic knowledge, which creates a highly perverse sense of attachment towards certain object, person, situation or end goal, that everything else becomes inferior and worthless. The underlying connectedness or unity of things is forgotten. Even a simple thing like cutting our face when shaving is a taamasic action, which has happened because our mental noise shifted our focus and attention away from the action. Similarly, whenever we eat food that is tasty but creates negative long term health impacts, whenever we give importance to our tongue, we are committing a taamasic action."

As we saw earlier, raajasic knowledge presents a highly fragmented, chopped-up version of the world. It gives reality to the differences created by the senses and the mind. Additionally, it gives different \u201cvalues\u201d to objects, people and situations perceived by the senses and the mind. Simply put, we either like, dislike, or are indifferent to objects, people and situations. A classic example is the precious stone that is liked by its owner, disliked by the owner\u2019s enemy, and treated with indifference by a monk.        Such raajasic knowledge results in commencement of raajasic action. Shri Krishna says that a raajasic action is begun in pursuit of an object, person or situation that will give pleasure to the doer of the action. It involves exertion of mental or physical effort, and therefore, the mind is good at calculating how much effort is needed for acquiring one object versus the other. Another aspect of the raajasic action is that the I, the ego, is given a lot of prominence. We want the entire world to know that we helped such and such person, or we did someone a favour. Unfortunately, such thinking interferes with the action, causing us to shift our attention from the action to the ego.        Let\u2019s constrast this with saattvic action. Instead of pursuing an object of pleasure, a saattvic action is done with a sense of duty. There is no calculation that weighs the effort needed for object a verses the effort needed for object b. All actions happen spontaneously. Also, there is no sense of egoism. Instead, there is a firm understanding that the action is being performed by me who is an instrument, a nimiitta, of Ishvara. This lack of egoistic thinking makes the actions more efficient. In fact, people with high degrees of sattva are the most productive, simply because they are performing their svadharma with no ulterior motive."

Now we come to the topic of the karma, the action itself. Knowledge is the main instigator of any action. So if the knowledge is saattvic, the action will be saattvic and so on. A simple way to differentiate between the three types of knowledge is the gauge the severity of the likes and dislikes, the raaga and dvesha, that the knowledge creates. When we only see unity and harmony, without any likes or dislikes, that is saattvic knowledge. When we have strong likes or dislikes for this object or that person or that situation, it is raajasic knowledge. When we have a extreme or perverted like or dislike, it is taamasic knowledge.        Imagine that you are a guest at a friend\u2019s house. A group of young children are playing a game of monopoly that they ask you to join. Some children want you to win, since you are in their team. The other team wants you to lose. At the conclusion of the game, you end up losing all your monopoly money. But you do not harbour any feelings of resentment or anger towards the children. Why does this happen? You have no attachment to the monopoly game, the money or property that you have acquired, since you know that it is not real.        Shri Krishna says that any action performed without attachment, without like or dislike towards any part or character in the action, without hankering for the reward of the action, such an action is a sattvic action. In other words, while commencing the action, our intent and our state of mind is saattvic. We will only be able to perform such an action if we have reduced our likes and dislikes towards material objects to a great extent. This happens only if we see the world as illusory and ephemeral, either through seeing everything as Ishvara\u2019s Prakriti or through meditation upon the hollowness of Maaya."

A person is holding onto something trivial and giving it so much importance that they will stop at nothing to get it. The logic used to justify such actions is perverted. Such people have an extremely narrow vision, and are not at all concerned with any the bigger picture. Shri Krishna says that a worldview, a knowledge that displays such characteristics is considered taamasic. He hesitates to even use the word knowledge here, using a pronoun instead.        Let us compare the types of knowledge we have seen so far. A saattvic knowledge reports that there is one eternal essence, one aatmaa, one self in all. Raajasic knowledge reports that there is a different self in each body. Taamasic knowledge reports that the body itself is the aatmaa. Furthermore, anything is justified for ensuring the integrity of the body, including causing physical harm to others. Such people will never accept any other viewpoint, and hold on to their perverted viewpoint ceaselessly."

Many times they would confront each other, and even try to kill each other, until the moment when someone told them that they were brothers. Within a second, the two brothers would reconcile their differences, join forces, and confront their common enemy. From an external and sensory standpoint, nothing changed. Only their knowledge became saattvic, since they now knew that they had their mother in common.        According to Shri Krishna, that knowledge which agrees with the report of the senses, which sees distinction between our self and the world, which sees divisions and separateness, that knowledge is raajasic. Everything is taken at face value. Saattvic knowledge, on the other hand, sees unity in diversity. Now raajasic vision is necessary from a vyavahaaric level, a transactional level, otherwise daily life would not be possible. If a businessman viewed everyone as his own self, he would not be able to survive. But if he maintained the attitude of business with his family, his knowledge would be confused and mixed up.        Most of us, it is safe to say, possess raajasic knowledge. We see our body as a unit separate and distinct from everyone else. Each person has a different aatmaa, a different self. Raajasic knowledge stays at the level of naama roopa, of name and form. It is easier, even enticing,  to think at the level of name and form than to think at the level of what\u2019s common between the names and forms. A slightly evolved version of raajasic knowledge takes the entire family unit as one entity. Whenever a good happens to our brother, it is as if that good has happened to us. When our parents suffer a loss, we suffer with them."

Shri Krishna now begins the analysis of knowledge. To recap, jnyaanam or knowledge here refers to the meaning given by an individual to information conveyed by the senses and the mind. The view of a large garden, for instance, could be interpreted differently by different people. A nature lover would rush towards it. A city dweller may think of it is a waste of living space. A real estate developer would imagine a resort being built on it, and all the consequent profits that follow from it.        Knowledge can be saattvic, raajasic or taamasic, since it is a product of Prakriti or nature. Sattvic knowledge is taken up here. The mind and the senses, by their very nature, report a diverse world. Shri Krishna says that the vision that can see unity within this diversity is called saattvic vision or knowledge. Few people have such a vision, since it is hard to fight against the normal tendency of the mind to chop up the world into fragments. Only someone with a saattvic vision like Mahatma Gandhi, for instance, could rally diverse and antagonistic states towards the idea of a united Indian nation.        Ultimately, a sattvic vision of seeing unity in diversity paves the way to understanding that the entire universe is pervaded by one single, imperishable, undivided entity. Initially, this entity is the eternal essence with attributes, the saguna brahman, also known as Ishvara. At the conclusion of the spiritual journey, the understanding evolves to recognize this entity as the nirguna brahman, the pure eternal essence, which is our own self. We can develop such a unified vision, this samyak darshana, through karma yoga. Instead of serving ourselves, we serve our family, then our community, our company, our state, our nation and eventually, Ishvara."

Jnyaanam or knowledge provides meaning to perception of an object, the jnyeyam. This perception, along with the meaning is provided to the jeeva, the individual soul, by the intellect. If the jeeva decides to be indifferent to this object, the matter ends there. If the jeeva decides to pursue that object, it commands the body to do whatever actions are necessary to obtain that object. While issuing the instructions, the jeeva becomes a doer or kartaa, and while experiencing the object, it becomes the experiencer of bhogtaa.         So why is this important? Each time we become the kartaa or the bhogtaa, we reinforce the notion that \u201cI am the jeeva\u201d, and forget our true nature as the eternal essence, who is the saakshi or witness to all thoughts and action. The spiritual journey start from our present situation, and raises us higher step by step, away from our entanglement in action and experience, and closer towards our true nature as the unattached eternal essence. Shri Krishna says, do not worry, there is a way out. Anything that is asat, anything that is not the eternal essence, is in the realm of Prakriti. And we have seen in the fourteenth chapter that Prakriti is nothing but the play of the three gunaas. If we truly understand how the process of action works from the standpoint of gunaas, we can begin to extricate ourselves from its tendency to entangle us.        The great sage Kapila Muni created the Saankhya school of philosophy. The science of the gunaas is part of the Saankhya school. By analyzing the nature of the three main components of action, jnyaanam, karma and kartaa, which means knowledge, action and the doer, we can check whether they are sattvic, raajasic or taamasic as pertaining to us. This shloka begins a new section within the eighteenth chapter that categorizes these three components and some other related factors as demonstrating the quality one of the three gunaas. It is extremely practical and also summarizes many key concepts from the first five chapters of the Gita."

Most of us, however, are still becoming qualified for this teaching through the practice of karma yoga. Shri Krishna recognizes the need to give an in depth analysis of action for people like us. To that end, he uses this shloka to begin that topic. Each word, each term needs to be understood clearly, since the regular meanings may confuse us.        So then, what is the genesis, the birth of an action? How does an action commence? Our sense organs send a report to the mind of having seen, felt, touched, tasted or smelled something. This is the process of perception. Or, a thought about a prior perception arises in the mind. Both these processes are the same for all people in this world. Both you and I perceive a red apple in the same manner. In this case, the red apple is termed as jneyam, an object which is known. This is step one.        What happens next? Both of us see the same red apple, but you may love it, someone else may hate it, and I would be indifferent to it. This difference in our view towards the apple, our worldview in general, is due to the difference in our sanskaaras. We attach a certain meaning to objects, people and situations based on our sanskaaras. This individual vision of the world is termed knowledge or jnyaanam. It looks at the object in question and generates a sense of attraction, repulsion or indifference. This is step two.        Next, this notion of attraction, repulsion or indifference creates a modification in the intellect called the \u201cdoer\u201d, the kartaa. It is a phantom, illusory entity which says \u201cI want the red apple, go get it\u201d, or \u201cI hate this red apple, throw it away\u201d. The doer issues these instructions to the karana, the organs of action, which then do as they are told. The action of grasping the apple or throwing it away is carried out. Note the the doer only comes into existence when there is attraction or repulsion. The jeeva is a witness, indifferent to likes or dislikes. So the doer, the organs of action and the object make up karma sangraha, the basis of action. This is step three.        When finally, the object, the target of action is consumed by the senses, another modification of the mind called the \u201cenjoyer\u201d, the bhoktaa, arises. It creates the notion that \u201cI have experienced this object, and it gave me joy/sorrow\u201d. This is the parijnyaata, the knower, mentioned in the shloka. Furthermore, a record of this experience, whether pleasurable or painful, is stored in the unconscious aspect of our personality, the causal body. This record, this samskaara, becomes the seed of future action by creating thoughts of desire in the mind, prompting further actions and experiences. This process of enjoyment of an object is the fourth step.        So these four steps taken together describe the lifecycle of an action, from start to finish."

Whenever we think \u201cI am performing this action\u201d, it is incorrect, born out of ignorance, it is durmati. Shri Krishna now gives us the correct understanding. When we think that \u201cthis action is being performed by the five factors of Prakriti, not by me\u201d, this is the correct understanding, this is sumati. And after the action is performed, we do not let the result of the action impact us. In other words, we are not attached to the reward of action.        The most common concern towards this kind of understanding is that it will make us weak and fatalistic, especially when we are still engaged in karma yoga. That is why it has to be combined with the idea of selfless service. A modern interpretation of this notion is : do your best, and leave the rest. As we continue our journey in karma yoga, our selfish desires and vaasanaas will slowly wither away, paving the way for the knowledge of the self in the second chapter to take root in our mind. Then we will come to the realization that only the self, the aatmaa is real or sat. Actions are in the realm of Prakriti, of Maaya, which is asat or illusory.        Per Shri Shankarachaarya\u2019s commentary, this shloka embodies the sum and substance of the Gita and even of all the Vedas. We start our lives thinking that we are the body. The scriptures, the Vedas, tell us that we are not the body, we are the jeeva who has to use his body and mind to perform selfless service. Now, at the conclusion of the Vedas, Veda-anta, we are told that we are beyond the jeeva. This attitude of non-identification with the doership of actions differentiatees a sanyaasi, a monk, from a tyaagi, one who has renounced action, per the original question of Arjuna in this chapter.        With the words \u201che kills, but does not kill\u201d, we are transported back to the second chapter, where Shri Krishna was convincing Arjuna to engage in the Mahaabhaarata war. So then, what is left? From a practical standpoint, we still have to deal with science of action. Unless we understand it fully, we will never be able to distance ourselves from the notion of doership. Shri Krishna continues his analysis of action from the standpoint of the three gunaas, since he has proven that action is in the realm of Prakriti."

Shri Shankaraachaarya provides these examples in this commentary of this shloka to drive home the point that what we see or experience may not really be the truth.        Shri Krishna says that our entire life is steeped in the incorrect notion that we perform actions. With regards to the analogies taken up, the self is stationary, and Prakriti is moving. But we do not see this because our intellect is untrained. It is akrita buddhi. We have not imbibed the knowledge that action is performed by the five factors mentioned in the prior shlokas. The scriptures, and Shri Krishna, are repeatedly informing us that ultimately Ishvara\u2019s Prakriti is performing all the actions, not our self, not the aatmaa, not the eternal essence. But we fail to see this. We are durmati, we have a perverted understanding.        Unless someone hears this statement from a teacher well versed in the scriptures, this ancient misunderstanding never comes up for questioning. The most common understanding is that the body is the self, the aatmaa. Some other people think that the jeeva, the individualized soul, is the aatmaa. But both these schools of thought attribute action to the aatmaa, which is incorrect. Furthermore, even the results of the actions go to the Prakriti. They do not go to the self, the aatmaa. The aatmaa is kevala, it is untainted, pure, and incapable of any change, modification or action. So then, what is the correct understanding? This is taken up next."

Any action that we perform has five components behind it. The body provides the foundation for the action. The instruments comprise the five organs of sense and the five organs of action. The energy system of the body, the praana, provides the fuel needed to perform the action. The individual notion, the ego, provides the motive behind the action. The daivam, Ishvara, ensures that the universe supports the performance of the action.        To drive home this point, Shri Krishna adds that there is no action that is beyond the realm of these five factors. In other words, the five factors are the material cause as well as the efficient cause or intelligence behind an action. Since a robot can perform any task that it is programmed with, it is easy to understand that the five factors are the material cause of the action. But when we say that they are also the intelligence behind the action, it is a little difficult to swallow. Our true self, the eternal essence, has nothing whatsoever to do with the action. The mind generates thoughts and the body performs actions.        Now, another point is taken up in the shloka. It is the very same five factors that can perform an action in conformance with the universe and its laws, as well as action that goes against the universe and its laws, also termed as a sinful action. The way a person looks at the world, as well as the nature of his intelligence, determines whether he will perform an action lawfully or sinfully. The entire process of action is analyzed in detail later in the chapter. This overview of the factors behind an action is concluded here, setting us up for the most important teaching of the Gita, taken up next."

For a robot to perform any action, there are at least three factors at work. First is the body of the robot, which will determine things like how fast or how powerful actions can be performed. Second is the instruments of the robot, such as its sensors, its hands, its wheels and so on. Third is the power system of the robot, which typically is electricity but could also be diesel or steam.        Shri Krishna says that whenever a human being performs an action, the same three factors come into play. The size of our body, the state of our instruments (organs of action and organs of sense) and our power system (our praana, our energy and health), each factor is responsible for the fate of our action. But there has to be something that differentiates us from robots, and therefore, two additional factors are mentioned: the kartaa or the doer, and the daivam or divinity.        The fourth component known as the kartaa, the doer, also known as the sense of agency, is nothing but the notion of finitude within us, what we normally term as the \u201cI\u201d. When our intellect plans an action, we say, \u201cI am thinking\u201d instead of saying \u201cthe intellect is thinking\u201d. When our hand is performing the action, we say \u201cI am sweeping the floor\u201d instead of \u201cthe hand is sweeping the floor\u201d. When our eyes perceive an obstacle, we say \u201cI see a wall\u201d instead of \u201cthe eyes see a wall\u201d. Seen in this manner, the sense of \u201cI\u201d is quite illusory. For now, we can say that it is the motive behind performance of action that identifies with a certain aspect of the mind or body, a certain upaadhi.        The fifth component of any action is the daivam, the divinity. Unless Ishvara supports an action, it will not result in success. Or we can say that the world, or the universe as a whole, also has a part in determining the outcome of an action. Despite everything executed perfectly at the individual level, it still has to align with the action at the universal level."

Typically we tend to think we are responsible for initiating, executing and completing every action, from the simplest action like drinking a cup of tea, to a complex action like planning the construction of a 100 storey building. He says that there are other factors are play which are responsible for the accomplishment of all actions, as denoted by the Saankhya or Vedaanta. He also conveys to Arjuna that a new topic has started, by calling out his name.        In the fourth chapter, we came across a shloka which stated that all actions in their totality culminate in knowledge. There are two components to this knowledge. The first is that the self, the eternal essence, the aatmaa, is actionless, since there is no possibility of change or modification in something that is changeless. This leads us to the second component of knowledge, which is as follows. If I, the self, am not performing action, something else must be doing so. As long as we are not fully convinced that something else is performing actions, we will hold on to the notion that we are doing so.        A naive person sits in a bus and thinks that he is driving it. You have to convince him that he is not driving it, but it is the bus driver that is driving it. In the same way, Shri Krishna gives us a detailed analysis of action and its components, such that we may come to the right conclusion. We are naive in thinking that the I, the self performs action when the Saankhya, the Vedaanta tells us that we do not. Once we come to this conclusion, we will automatically renounce the doership of action, and consequently, free ourselves from the chain of action and reaction."

Every action has a reaction, and this reaction is also known as the phala, result or fruit of the action. When we cross the road to catch a bus, we could get one of three results. We could catch the bus, we could miss the bus, or we could get into a packed bus with no room for seating. The result could be desirable, undesirable or mixed. This is a law of the universe, no different than the law of gravity. The fruit always comes to the performer of the action, with the same certainty as the bill collector comes to collect a debt, per the words of Sant Jnyaneshwar.        Any fruit that is found in nature contains seeds. These seeds can create trees that can generate many more fruits. Similary, every fruit that results from an action has the potential to create innumerable desires that result in even more actions. This infinite chain of action, reaction, fruit, desire and action is nothing but bondage or samsaara. One who is an atyaagi, one who has not given up attachment to fruits of action, is bound in this chain. By practicing karmayoga, by giving up attachment to the fruit of action, we can break this chain.        Now, let us proceed to the next phase of karma yoga. As long as we hold the notion that we are performing all actions, we cannot proceed further in the journey of a seeker. Performance of action is falsely superimposed on the eternal essence which is beyond all action, beyond all change. The second chapter made it very clear that there can be no change in the aatmaa, the eternal essence. Unless we fully internalize the notion that our \u201cI\u201d, our self does not perform action, we will remain entrenched in samsaara. Shri Krishna says that only a sanyaasi, only one who sees that Prakriti really performs actions, can destroy current, past and future fruits of action. This topic is elaborated in the following shlokas."

Shri Krishna used this question as an opportunity to recap the topic of karma yoga. After pointing out some popular notions on the topic, he then asserted that karma yoga refers to performance of duties while giving up attachment to their reward. This is the saattvic type of renunciation or tyaaga. He also explained the raajasic and the taamasic types of tyaaga.        Now, Shri Krishna adds another bit of context to the topic of karma yoga. He asserts that one who has a strong sense of identification to his body cannot completely give up action. He uses the term deha-bhrit, which is similar to the term dehi from the second chapter. As long as we identify with a sports team, for instance, we will be happy or say whenever they win or lose. As long as we think we are Mr. or Ms. so-and-so who has a job and a family and a house and so on, we have a strong sense of identification with our body. We cannot fully give up actions since the body has to act in order to live in this world.        With this additional context, we can now understand the definition of tyaagi. The ordinary meaning of this word refers to one who has renounced, who has given up all actions. Shri Krishna redefines it to mean someone who has given up all attachment to the reward of action, not given up action itself. If we are true karma yogis, we are tyaagis per this definition. We still need to deal with the issue of our strong identification to the body. This topic is taken up next."

Shri Krishna now describes the nature of the person who conducts renunciation in the proper manner, the saattvic tyaagi. Such a person is pervaded by sattva. This means that his intellect is able to discriminate between what is real and what is not, in other words, what is the eternal essence and what is the illusory world. This person is described as medhaavee, one who is wise due to the knowledge of the eternal essence, the self.        What makes this person different than the other so-called renouncers? It is his indifferent attitude towards action. Though he knows that every action has the potential to generate further sorrow and further desires, he does not hate that action but in fact, continues to do his duty. Conversely, though he knows that doing his duty will eventually make him fit for liberation, or if there is some action that he loves to perform, he does not develop a sense of attachment for it.        Eventually, a slow transformation takes place in such a person. Performing karma yoga, which is the same as performing saattvika tyaaga, leads a person to slowly recognize his true nature as the unchanging, unmoving eternal essence. He begins to realize that he is not performing any action at all, it is Prakriti that is doing all the work. When he comes to realize this, he becomes chinnasamshayaha, free of all doubts about who he really is, about his true nature."

Let us look at this step by step. The first step is to only perform actions that are within the realm of our state in life, our aashrama, and our career, our varna. Actions that are prohibited or actions that are purely out of selfishness should not be performed. These actions are termed as niyatam karma in the shloka. A high degree of awareness is required to first ensure that we are not stepping into any prohibited actions.        The second step is to give up attachment to the reward, the phala, the fruit, of the action. Attachment to the reward need not be something tangible and physical. It could be subtle things like praise and adoration received from others on successful completion of the action. It could be a subtle thought such as \u201cI have helped that person, so nice of me to do so\u201d. The goal is to slowly wean the mind away from its natural tendency to expect rewards for every action. We can do so my substituting our personal motive with a motive for selfless service.        The third step is to give up attachment to the action itself. We saw the types of attachment to action in the previous shloka, including attachment to the completion of action and attachment to one particular way of performing the action. The key is to realize that at every moment, we are giving it the best of our ability and attention. The rest is upto Ishvara, since there are several other factors at play in the outcome of an action. But in no circumstance should our energy level go down. We have to combine energy in our work with indifference to the reward of the work."

Earlier, we came across some people who claim to be performing spiritual renunciation of action, or the giving up of action, when in reality they are lazy, idle or careless in performing their obligatory duties. Now Shri Krishna describes another misinterpretation of tyaaga or giving up. He says that those who give up their duties simply because they will cause sorrow or distress to their body are practising tyaaga that is raajasic.        Many times we may shirk from performing our job at work, or perform a job half heartedly, because we think it will cause us pain or sorrow. We may have to give some bad news to a client. We may have to fire an underperforming employee. We may procrastinate starting a project because we may have to put in some extra hours. Such behaviour could come into our family lives as well. We may hesitate in helping out a relative because we may have to expend some of our money and energy.        Why do we fear pain or sorrow? We tend to forget many of the teachings of the second chapter. We are not the body, our true nature is the eternal essence. But we have a strong sense of attachment to the body and the mind. We are advised to patiently develop titkshaa, the quality of forbearance, towards pain and sorrow while discharging our duties. Instead, we fall back into our old ways of thinking and run away from our duties. Shri Krishna says that people who abandon their duties out of fear of pain and sorrow will not get the fruit of giving up actions, which is purity and peace of mind."

He says that when we give up an obligatory action, when we do not perform an obligatory action out of delusion, out of incorrect or error prone knowledge, such renunciation is known as taamasic tyaaga or taamasic renunciation. He says that such behaviour is inappropriate and is not in line with the teachings of karma yoga. Not doing one\u2019s duty is forbidden in karma yoga.        Where do one\u2019s obligatory duties come from? They come from one\u2019s stage in life or aashrama, and one\u2019s profession or varna. A householder is obliged to attend to the needs of his spouse, his parents and his children. If he does not attend to his sick parents, or does not help with his child\u2019s homework, it is termed as taamasic behaviour. A businessman should strive to generate healthy profits from his business, and donate a portion of his wealth to charity. Not doing so is also considered taamasic.        Moha or delusion can create all kinds of negative tendencies in us, as we have seen in prior chapters. It can cause heedlessness and carelessness where we do not pay proper attention to the task at hand. It can cause laziness and idleness where our body becomes inert and dull, where we do not want to get up from bed. It is hard to get oneself out of a state of moha. Unless someone who is not taamasic intervenes, we will remain in a state of tamas for a long time."

Consider an architect who spends months creating the plans for a building. If the architect designs the building keeping the bonus payment in mind, he is performing the action with an attitude of selfishness. If the architect designs the building with the sole motive of creating the best possible living space for people, he is performing the action with an attitude of selflessness.        Let us be clear about one thing. There is nothing wrong in the architect expecting a fair payment for the rendering of his services. But he does not keep a monetary expectation every second of his time while designing his buildings. He does it out of a sense of duty. His svadharma, which means his aptitude, his training and his passion, is to be an architect. Regardless of how his day goes, he derives joy in the performance of his svadharma, his duty to the world, as an architect.        In addition to giving up attachment to the reward of action, Shri Krishna also advises us to give up attachment to the action itself. Here, we have to keep two things in mind. First, it is not guaranteed that every action of ours will be successful, since there are external factors that may intervene. Second, even if we insist that an action should be performed in a certain way, there could be other ways that could sometimes work better. Insisting that every action ends successfully, and that every action has to be done our way, are the two ways in which we get attached to action. Giving up these attachments, along with the attachment to reward, is the only way that we get bring the purifying effect of karma yoga into every action we perform. This is Shri Krishna\u2019s foremost conclusion on karma yoga."

Instead of creating the criteria from scratch, he uses a viewpoint mentioned earlier as the basis. He says that nitya karmas, the obligatory duties towards society, Ishvara and oneself should be performed. They should never be given up. Only nishiddha karmas or prohibited actions, and kaamya karmas or selfish actions should be given up.        This criteria is to be followed by those who are maneeshi, who are wise, who have understood that blind pursuit of material gain is not for them. Such people are interested in liberation only. When these wise people perform their obligatory duties, the performance of those actions acts as a cleanser, a purifier. All traces of raaga and dvesha, likes and dislikes, are slowly cleared out by the performance of obligatory duties. Their actions are propelled out of an attitude of seva or service, not out of personal and selfish likes and dislikes.        So then, if this is the case, how should one treat actions performed for one\u2019s career? If we love our career, and it gives us a personal reward in the form of salary, should we give up that as well? We need to resolve this issue by converting our reward oriented actions into selfless actions. Only then will we be able to weaken the samskaaraas or mental impressions that impel us to perform our career oriented actions every day. What is the technique by which we can convert our selfish actions into selfless actions? This is taken up next."

Before we delve into Shri Krishna\u2019s answer, let us go through the viewpoints and analyze their merits. The most extreme viewpoint from the previous shloka advocated the complete abandonment of all actions. We have already seen in earlier chapters that it is impossible for the human body to remain without performing actions for its survival. Therefore, this viewpoint is impractical and has to be rejected.        A less extreme viewpoint advocated the abandonment of all selfish actions. Even this is impractical since it is impossible for someone to suddenly quit performing only selfish actions and continue with the rest. So we can reject this viewpoint as well. Two other viewpoints remain. One is performing actions that are obligations towards our fellow human beings, towards Ishvara and towards ourselves. The other is to remove our attachment towards the rewards of all actions.        Shri Krishna begins providing his definition by first praising Arjuna for asking the clarifying question, since it gives an opportunity to summarize the teaching of karma yoga for all future students of the Gita. Arjuna gets two wonderful titles from Shri Krishna, bhratasattama and purushavyaagraha. Shri Krishna also indicates that he will classify tyaaga or giving up actions into three types, saattvic raajasic and taamasic. In fact, a major portion of this chapter will continue this theme of three fold classification."

The second view is that one should give up the rewards of all types of actions, including kaamya karmas and nitya karmas or duties. Giving up does not mean physically giving up the reward. It means giving up the attachment to the reward in our mind.        Before sharing his definition of karma yoga, Shri Krishna describes two other viewpoints on karma yoga. He says that maneeshees, those who have a contemplative bent of mind, advise that it is futile to undertake any action, because all actions are filled with some fault or the other. They are of the opinion that any action, no matter how small, eventually grows in size, binds us and makes us dance to its tune. Such people prefer to lead a life of monkhood and spend their time immersed in thinking and contemplation.        The fourth viewpoint on karmayoga advocates similar but less radical approach than the prior viewpoint. It narrows the scope of actions to just three: sacrifice, charity and penance. In other words, you have to fulfill your obligations towards Ishvara, your fellow human beings, and to yourself. So then, what actions are left out here? This viewpoint does not sanction the performance of actions with regards to our profession, our career and so on. It assumes that one can live without earning a livelihood."

Shri Krishna did not answer this question directly. He wanted to answer the question in such a way that Arjuna would be able to put the answer into practical use, and not get caught in complicated semantics, something that has only academic value. It was almost as though he said \u2013 Arjuna, you don\u2019t worry about the difference in meaning of sanyaasa and tyaaga for now. You are a warrior, a kshatriya. I will tell you what is appropriate for you such that you can advance spiritually.        Before we analyze Shri Krishna\u2019s answer, let us revisit the classifications of karmas or actions. Our actions are determined by two factors: our varna or profession, and our ashrama or stage in life. Based on these two factors, we can classify our actions broadly into three types: obligatory duties or nitya karmas, desire prompted actions or kaamya karmas and prohibited actions or nishiddha karmas. Raising a family is a duty for a householder, whereas it is prohibited for a brahmachaari or student, for instance. Reckless accumulation of wealth, beyond that which is needed to support a family, is desire prompted action.        Now let us look at Shri Krishna\u2019s answer. Looking at the way he answers the question, we can infer that initially, he is less concerned with the precise meaning of sanyaasa versus tyaaga, and more concerned with listing the various views on the topic of karma yoga, of how to perform actions correctly. He gives two prevailing views on the subject. The first view is that one should give up all kaamya karmas, all desire prompted actions. The second view is that one should give up the rewards of all types of actions, including kaamya karmas and nitya karmas or duties. He gives two more views on the topic in the next shloka."

It addresses many topics and themes covered in the entire Gita, and ties up many loose ends as well. It is the most practical among all of the chapters, containing lessons applicable every aspect of our life. Arjuna begins this chapter with a question to Shri Krishna. He wants to know what is the difference between two terms \u2013 sannyaasa and tyaaga.        At a superficial level, both the terms have a common meaning which is renunciation. Arjuna probably had come across these terms being used in scriptures or chants, and wanted to know whether there was a difference. But this question is similar to his query in regards to the difference between karma yoga and jnyaana yoga in the third chapter, and the difference between karma yoga and karma sanyaasa in the fifth chapter. Broadly, he wants to know when to act and when not to act. It is a good question because the topic of karma contains many nuances that require clarification and elaboration, which are found in this chapter.        It is interesting to look at the three titles used by Arjuna to address Shri Krishna. Hrisheekesha is one who has conquered the senses. Mahabaaho is one who is mighty armed, one who has tremendous power and energy. Keshinisudana is one who has killed the demon Keshi, who is an enemy. Therefore, only one who has conquered the senses can gain power to destroy one\u2019s internal and external enemies."

Arjuna, foreseeing that not many people will have access to the scriptures in the future, wanted to know about the state of those people who use faith to guide their actions instead of scriptures. Shri Krishna replied that faith comes from svabhaava, from one\u2019s stock of past samskaaraas or impressions. In this chapters, he analyzes svabhaava through studying what food we eat, what actions we perform, and with which attitude do we perform those actions.        The bulk of the chapter is the analysis of food, sacrifice, charity and penance. Yajnya or sacrifice represents our duty towards Ishvara. Daana or charity represents our duty towards our fellow human beings. Tapas represents our duty towards ourselves. All of these are classified into three types: saattvic, raajasic and taamasic. Penance is broken down into three components: bodily, mental and speech. A warning against extreme and harsh penance is also given so that we do not harm ourselves or others.        Through this chapter, we are urged by Shri Krishna to reduce and ultimately stop raajasic and taamasic actions, and cultivate saattvic actions. This will purify our mind and make us fit for imbibing the knowledge of the eternal essence. However, even our saattvic actions may still have some defects or errors, which can be removed with the chanting of the purifier Om Tat Sat. In fact, as long as our steadfastness, our sthiti, is in Ishvara, all actions will automatically become saattvic."

Furthermore, with the application of the purifier Om Tat Sat, it becomes a means towards liberation. Here, such kind of action is compared with an action that is performed without any faith or steadfastness whatsoever. Action performed without any faith is called as asat, which literally means non reality or devoid of reality.        In our daily life, we can immediately tell the difference between one who puts their heart and soul into their actions, and one who is just going through the motions. We ourselves have instances where we love an action so much that we put everything in it, we get lost in it, and  some other actions where we are acting like mechanical machines, like robots. Shri Krishna says that any action, any sacrifice, penance or charity performed without faith, without our soul in it, becomes a worthless action. Forget liberation, it will not even yield a result here, on this earth.        With this shloka, Shri Krishna concludes the seventeenth chapter on the three types of faith. He says that there are three types of devotees based on the texture of their faith, and are categorized as saattvic, raajasic and taamasic. In order to make ourselves fit for liberation, we should cultivate saatvic faith and eliminate the other two types of faith. This will happen only by consuming saattvic food and performing saattvic sacrifices, charity and penance. To ensure that our saatvic actions are free of errors and defects, we should use the purifier Om Tat Sat while performing the actions.         om tatsatiti shreematbhagavatgitasupanishadsu brahmavidyaayaam yogashaastre shreekrishnaarjunsamvade shraddhatrayovibhaagayogo naama saptadashodhyaayaha || 15 ||"

Any sattvic action will be freed of defects, attachment to the action and its reward will be weakened, all notions of duality will be muted when we use this purifying chant. Now we may say that in this day and age, we may not have the time to follow the guidelines given in this chapter to make our actions and our intake sattvic. Following the guidelines in the scriptures is beyond our scope anyway.        As usual, Shri Krishna makes things easy for us. He says our stithi, our steadfastness is towards Ishvara, is the most important thing to pay attention to. If we take care of our steadfastness, and chant Om Tat Sat with that steadfastness, every action that we perform will become sattvic and a means towards liberation. What does sthithi or steadfastness mean? It is that which our mind is occupied the most. If we keep a notebook next to our bed, and write down the first thought that comes to mind when we wake up, we will know what our stithi is within a few days.        Many people say that a sport such as cricket or tennis is their life. Others say that it is their career, others say it is their family, others say it is their family and so on. It is the first thought that they wake up with in the morning. When our first thought, and also, the constant background thought throughout the day is that of Ishvara, all our actions will automatically become sattvic. We will not have to take any additional precaution or follow any other guideline. For instance, if we are in constant thought of Ishvara, we will never think of donating anything with a view to get something back in return. Action follows thought, and with the constant thought of Ishvara, actions take care of themselves."

We may have not followed some guidelines, or some external entity may have caused some problem which we may be unaware of. For most of us who are not well versed in the scriptures, is there an easy solution to this problem?        Shri Krishna says that the chanting of the word Sat during the performance of a saattvic action has the effect of removing all the errors and defects of that action. This is why words such as satkarma (good actions) and sadaachaar (good conduct) use sat as a synonym for good. But just purifying an action is not enough. The emotions, the feelings behind the action are equally important. Chanting of the word Sat has the effect of purifying our emotions as well. Words such as sadbhaava (good emotion) and sadguna (good values) illustrate this point.        The real meaning of the word Sat, however,is existence. It is a pointer to brahman, the eternal essence, the one reality. \u201cNaabhaavo vidyate sataha\u201d found in the second chapter of the Gita denotes that Sat, the eternal essence, always exists. It is always complete, without any duality. Therefore, the ultimate goal of uttering Sat is to mentally remove any notions of duality, mentally remove all the upaadhis or limitations, and merge oneself into the one reality, the one eternal essence."

The primary obstacle in karmayoga is attachment at two levels. We are attached to the personal reward of an action. We are also attached to the act itself. For instance, a musician may become attached to the royalties promised to him in his recording contract. He may also become attached to the unique style of music that he has developed.        Shri Krishna says that chanting the word \u201cTat\u201d when performing any saattvic action has the effect of removing these two kinds of attachment. Tat means \u201cthat\u201d in sanskrit. It is a pointer to the eternal essence in its transcendent aspect, also known as Ishvara. Using the word Tat, we can dedicate our actions and results to any deity that we like. The act is performed by Ishvara, therefore the reward goes to Ishvara. I am only the instrument of Ishvara. This is the attitude developed when Tat is chanted with faith.        How does this work? Imagine that you are going overseas for closing a business deal. If you go with attitude that you am doing this deal for yourself, then you have to take on the associated stress that comes with the deal. But if you go with attitude that you are closing the deal for your boss or your company, your stress will significantly reduce. You are just carrying out instructions given by your boss. If the deal works out, great, otherwise there will always be another opportunity."

To call someone, we need their number. To hear a radio station, we need to tune the radio to the station\u2019s frequency. Similarly, before we begin an action, we need to align our mind, to connect our mind, to Ishvara. We can only do so when the level of likes and dislikes, of raaga and dvesha, has been reduced to a great extent. Is there a way, a technique, by which we can quickly calm our mind down, and tone down our likes and dislikes?        Shri Krishna suggests that we chant Om prior to performing any sattvic action. Doing so sets up vibrations in our system that reduce our likes and dislikes, and clear our mind of selfish thoughts. Visualizing the symbol of Om while chanting it is even better. Om has been used in this manner by those who have faith in the scriptures, who are performing acts of sacrifice, penance or charity. The more frequently we begin actions with Om, the more we will bring sattva into our actions.        In the Jnyaneshwari, Sant Jnyaneshwar points out that Om has an additional feature. Normally, acts of sacrifice, penance and charity bind us through attachment to their results. By adding Om, also known as the Pranava, to the start of any action helps us focus on the action and weakens attachment to the result. He says that the chanting of Om while commencing an action is as valuable as a steady light in deep darkness, and as an able-bodied companion while travelling in a jungle."

Shri Krishna replied that we need to infer this from our actions and the attitude behind our actions. He then showed us the three types of food, sacrifice, penance and charity. The takeaway for us is that we should slowly stop performing raajasic and saatvic actions, and increase our saattvic actions. But even if we manage to perform only sattvic actions, there will always be the chance of some error creeping in.        Here, Shri Krishna gives us a formula, a technique to remove errors and defects in saattvic actions. This purifier is the combination of three words \u2013 Om, Tat and Sat. All three words are indicators of the eternal essence, of brahman. In fact, each of these words has been used in the Vedas to refer to the eternal essence. Om comes up in the Rig Veda. Tat and Sat come up in the Chhaandogya Upanishad. The word Sat is also used in the second chapter of the Gita to refer to the eternal essence. Note that the eternal essence is beyond name and form. These words are only pointers.        Next, Shri Krishna gives us the heritage of this purifier. Prajaapati, Lord Brahma, created the universe along with the sacrifice and the Vedas, as we have seen in the third chapter. He also created braahmanaas, who performed rituals and sacrifices with faith in the Vedas. These braahmanaas would always use Om Tat Sat to purify their sacrifices, to remove any defects in the rituals. Now, per the teaching of karma yoga, whenever we perform saattvic actions, they automatically become a sacrifice. Therefore, even we can use Om Tat Sat to purify our saattvic actions."

He says that charity performed without considering a proper time and place is considered taamasic. If we donate on a whim rather than doing so on an auspicious day, for instance, we introduce a tinge of our ego into the donation. Also, gifts that trouble the recipient, gifts given out of complete ignorance, are taamasic as well. Donating an expensive TV to a person who is struggling to eat does not make sense.        Many people nowadays take pleasure in insulting their priest or their teacher while giving them a gift, simply because they are drunk with power and money. Such charity in which an insult, a slur or a taunt is given along with the gift also becomes taamasic. If we disrespect the recipient of our charity, we are harming ourselves and the recipient instead of performing an auspicious act. A gift should always be given with politeness and humility. Furthermore, gifts should never be given to unworthy persons such as robbers and criminals.        We should be careful, however, to use our judgement and our discretion while performing charity, and not abstain for charity just because we are worried about going against the rules prescribed here. There are millions of people around the world that struggle to survive, that are in need of food, water, clothing and medicine. If we donate money to any institution that provides needy people with these amenities, we may not have control over the time and place of the donation, but that should not stop us. More broadly, there are instances where our acts of sacrifice, penance and charity may have a defect in them. Shri Krishna gives us a formula to deal with them next."

Let me give a new year gift to to my neighbour, so that he will come to my aid if I am in trouble and so on. In all these thoughts, a tinge of selfishness has crept in. Shri Krishna says that the giving of charity, and gifts in general, while expecting something in return, is raajasic charity.        Furthermore, charity is also performed to repay a favour or an obligation to someone else. This is referred to as \u201cpratyupkaara\u201d in the shloka. For instance, repaying a favour with cash sometimes is frowned upon socially. We may then think about repaying the favour through a charitable donation or a gift in kind. Such charity is also considered raajasic, because a business mindset, a transaction oriented mindset has come into the picture. We are not really performing charity, we are doing a business deal.        The most raajasic form of charity is when we donate something with the feeling of \u201cpariklishtam\u201d. It means doing something reluctantly, unwillingly, with a heavy heart, with a feeling of sadness. We are so attached to the money or goods being donated that we cannot bear to see them separated from us. We will think hundred times before donating anything. What will happen if I donate this? How will I replace it? Will I need it again? Our mamatva, our sense of mine-ness is quite strong, and needs to be examined."

Food gives us energy to serve the world, to perform sacrifice. Penance enables us to conserve and channel that energy towards sacrifice. Sacrifice results in a result that is received by the recipient of the sacrifice as well as to us, the performers of the sacrifice. Accumulating results beyond what we need to support ourselves and our family can result in greed. To check this greed, we need to perform daanam or charity.        Now, even the attitude towards charity can reveal a lot about the texture of our faith. Shri Krishna described the characteristics or conditions of charity performed with a saattvic attitude. Conducting charity out of a sense of duty is the first condition. It should come naturally to us, and not because someone has asked us to do it. Charity should never be treated as a business deal. For instance, if someone has done us a favour, we should not give him something in the guise of charity. Furthermore, we should not donate something expecting something in return.        Charity is a sacred act, therefore it has to be performed thoughtfully. Tossing a coin to a beggar on the street may be a noble act, but it does not quality as an act of saattvic charity. It has to be done at the right place and during an auspicious occasion. It also has to be directed towards a worthy person. Shri Shankaraachaarya in his commentary gives the example of the occasion of Sankraanti, the beginning of the month, as an auspicious occasion. He also gives the example of a learned teacher as one who is worthy of receiving a charitable donation."

Eventually, they carry out their mission, in which a great deal of harm is caused to others, and to themselves as well. Either they get captured or they harm themselves in the process.        Shri Krishna describes taamasic penance in this shloka. He says that penance based on a foolish notion, a misconception or an infatuation comes out of the minds of taamasic individuals. The end goal of such penance is to cause great harm to others or to oneself. We can always refer to the Puraanas for the fate of individuals who conduct severe penance just to bring about the downfall of someone else. So called \u201cblack magic\u201d is also conducted for harming someone.        We may look at this and dismiss it, since it sounds so extreme and not applicable to our daily lives. But many of us sometimes perform actions with a malicious intent. Politics sometimes becomes a venue for one party to perform actions simply for bringing the other party down, and not for the welfare of the country. Similarly, many people run businesses based on a personal vendetta. For instance, a person fired from a business may join a competitor just to get back. Any action performed for bringing someone else down usually backfires."

Hiranyakashipu performed such severe penance that his entire flesh dropped off and only his bones remained. However, none of these demons desired self realization or liberation as the outcome of their penance. They wanted some boon, some power such that they could vanquish their enemies.        Shri Krishna says that whenever we conserve our energy and put in a lot of effort towards any material goal, any goal which is \u201cof this world\u201d, such type of penance will be called raajasic. This penance could be for boosting our ego, in other words, for praise, honour, worship or for showing off. People spend years working extremely hard so that they can buy a fancy house or a car that can be shown off. Dictators do everything they can to ensure that people fall at their feet and worship them.        Ultimately, any effort that is expended towards an earthly goal will be temporary. A simple illustration to explain this notion is that of a ball thrown by a person in the air. No matter how hard the throw is, the ball will eventually fall down and stop moving. Furthermore, any result that we see in the world is also unstable. Several people go on crash diets that, in addition to giving temporary results, may actually harm the body. Any result in the material world is subject to the laws of Prakriti, to the three gunaas themselves, which are inherently unstable."

Tapas is used to conserve and channel our energy in the pursuit of a goal or objective, whether it be material or spiritual. Shri Krishna now describes three types of tapas, and how they can be used to assess the texture of our faith. He first describes the conditions under which penance is revealed to be sattvic.        The unique nature of sattvic tapas is that it is performed in the pursuit of the highest possible goal, which is self realization. It is not performed for any material gain, or the pursuit of physical or mental powers. Furthermore, it is performed with the utmost faith in the statements of the scriptures. Shri Krishna uses the word naraha or human in this shloka, and not in the shlokas that described the other two types of penance. He implies that only humans have the ability to perform penance without expectation of material gain.        Who has the ability to perform this highest level of penance, this sattvic penance? It is one who is yukta, one who has integrated his mind with his intellect, one who can remain balanced in success and failure. Only such a person is able to incorporate all the three aspects of penance, physical, mental and speech, referred in the shloka as three fold. Even if one of these is missing, the tapas loses its sattvic aspects. Mental penance is the toughest of all the three, since it is hardest to conquer the mind."

Shri Krishna now lists the qualities that indicate penance of mind, maanasika tapas. He begins with prasaadaha, a cheerful, joyful attitude towards situations in life. It comes from maintaining our balance and composure in troublesome as well as in happy situations. Saumyatvam refers to developing a gentleness and gracefulness when dealing with people.  It requires us to remain free from negative attitudes towards people that manifest as jealousy, violence, cruelty and so on.        The next quality is maunam. Literally, maunam mean silence, but here it means silence that comes out of contemplation. Now,  we cannot stop negative thoughts from arising in our mind, but we can always control how much time and attention we give to such thoughts. Whenever such negative thoughts arise, we have to be able to switch to a positive thought immediately. Doing so requires high levels of self control or aatma vinigrahaha, also known as shamaha. If we do not learn how to do this, the mind will hold onto a negative thought and get swept away in a mental whirlpool of negativity.        When we constantly maintain all the above mentioned qualities, our mind will automatically begin to harbour good intentions, even against so-called evil people and tough situations. The key to do this comes back to our outlook towards the world. We need to do one of two things. If we have faith in Ishvara, we need to surrender to him and reduce our dependence on the perishable material world. Alternatively, we treat the entire world as mithyaa, as an illusion, and negate everything in it. As long as we give absolute reality to the world, mental penance is next to impossible."

For instance, what is true may not always be the most pleasant thing to convey. In the office, we have to deliver all kinds of messages to people without them losing face. Even in the home, while talking to spouse, just conveying information factually does not always work best. Therefore, putting thought into choosing our words carefully has practical as well as spiritual benefits.        Now, many of us have an urge to say something when we are by ourselves. Here, Shri Krishna suggests that we recite scriptures daily, like chanting the second chapter of the Gita, for instance. Doing so satisfies our urge of speaking, and also forces the mind to contemplate the Gita teaching rather than stray here and there. In fact, it becomes a form of meditation as well. Once we memorize the shlokas, we can contemplate upon them whenever we want, without having to rely on a book."

He now begins the topic of tapas, which means penance or austerity. Through tapas we ensure that the energy that we derive from consuming food can be conserved and channeled into our actions. This tapas or penance is also of three types, saattvic, raajasic and taamasic. But penance itself needs to be broken down into its three main components first. Here, we examine the first component which is bodily or physical penance, shaaririka tapas.        Penance of the body begins with bowing down to, respecting, and serving our deities, our elders and our teachers. Deities also means the gods representing elemental forces such as Varun, lord of the seas. This means that we should worship and take care of all the natural resource this world has to offer. Offering service to something greater than us also has the effect of checking our aham, our ego, our illusory notion of who we are. It increases our humility and decreases our individuality.        Shaucham refers to purity of our body and our surroundings. If we keep our room unclean or cluttered, it is an indication that our mind is also unclean, or is cluttered with useless thoughts. Aarjavam or straightforwardness refers to our posture. We will not be able to meditate unless we are able to maintain an erect posture. This straightforwardness of the body is also a pointer to making our thinking straightforward, without any trace of deceit. Brahmacharyam refers to stopping our checking the excessive straying of our sense organs into their respective objects, like watching too much TV or consuming a lot of rich food. Ahimsa or non violence prevents us from harming anyone or anything using our body."

He says that taamasic attitude towards action totally disregards shaastra or scripture. Scripture refers to a  higher law, any notion of ethics or morality. There is no thought as to the consequence of the action to oneself and to other individuals whatsoever. Any task done without proper planning or performed haphazardly falls into this category.        Next, Shri Krishna says that there is no distribution of food in the sacrifice. In the taamasic attitude, the person not only claims the results of the action as their own, but goes to great lengths to ensure that no one else gains the benefit of the action, even if it is their due. For instance, if a business has a good year, the owner may hoard the profits instead of giving employees a bonus. Furthermore, the taamasic attitude does give respect or listen to advice of senior people, referred to as \u201cpriests\u201d in this shloka.        The main problem with the taamasic attitude is that all actions are performed with lack of faith. In other words, actions are performed for all the wrong reasons \u2013 someone else told us to perform the action, we are just doing it for the sake of doing it, we are doing it grudgingly, we are not putting our heart into it, we are not involved in it and so on. The performance of actions is as if it is being done by a lifeless entity, a corpse."

Continuing with this theme, Shri Krishna describes the attitude with which a raajasic person performs his actions. He says that such a person constantly thinks \u201cwhat is in it for me\u201d in each and every action he performs. Personal gain is paramount, anyone else\u2019s gain is secondary or even overlooked. Such a person is also constantly interested in the impression created by his action in the minds of others, and how will it benefit him. In other words, his actions are only performed for name and fame, for show and display. There is always an ulterior motive.        So far we have heard about the attitudes of saattvic and raajasic people towards action. This may raise several questions with respect to our life. We may say, I am a businessman, how can I not think what is in it for me? To answer this, we need to go back to the notion of our svadharma, our chosen career path. As long as ethics and laws are observed, a businessman should absolutely be focused on maximizing profits, otherwise he is not performing his duty. However, the businessman\u2019s profit motive should only be restricted to business deals. A transaction mindset creeps into interactions with friends and family, it ends up causing trouble.        Now, we may be tempted to point our fingers at those who spend a lot of time and energy in maintaining their appearance. We may also say, when others make negative comments about our appearance, we do not get stressed. All this is well and good. However, we may get insulted or stressed when someone comments upon our intellect or our competency in our job. This means that we harbour a strong sense of aham, a strong sense of the \u201cI\u201d notion with our intellect. This stress is also an indicator that somewhere within us, the texture of our faith is tinged with rajas."

He now lists the types of yajnya, the types of sacrificial rituals for worship, so that we can analyze the texture of our faith through them. Yajnyas are extremely elaborate rituals, but can be reduced to three basic components \u2013 the offering, the flame and the result. The person conducting the ritual uses items such as oil or butter as an offering to the deity. The deity is represented by the flame that consumes the offering. A yajnya is typically performed with a specific goal or result in mind, such as a longer life, marriage, children, prosperity and so on.        How does this matter to us in today\u2019s day and age? Symbolically, yajnya refers to all of our interactions with any entity or object in this world, and comprises of the very same components. First, the offering is the effort we put in to perform an action. This action could be something we perform at our job, for example. Second, the flame represents the recipient of our action. Lastly, the recipient responds to our action in the form of a result, which could e something tangible such as money, or intangible, such as goodwill towards us.        As we saw earlier, three people can perform the same action with three different attitudes of sattva, rajas and tamas. Here, Shri Krishna describes the attitude of a saatvic person. Such a person performs his action driven by a sense of duty to a higher ideal, without any selfish desire. The higher ideal could be service of one\u2019s country, for instance. There is no expectation of any result from the recipient of the action. Furthermore, the action is performed in line with a set of selfless laws, such as the law of a country, humanitarian laws, or laws that have come from scripture."

The first quality he describes is \u201cyaata yaamam\u201d. A \u201cyaama\u201d is equal to three hours. So any food that was cooked more than three hours ago is considered \u201cyaata yaamam\u201d or stale. \u201cGata rasam\u201d refers to food that has lost its essence, its nutritional value, its \u201crasa\u201d. Any junk food or processed food comes under this classification, as does food that has not been fully cooked.        It may surprise us to see Shri Krishna explicitly mention putrid or rotten food in this shloka, since we may think no one would ever eat such food. But there are people in this world who prefer eating food that has an odour to it. He also adds to the list leftover food and food that has already been tasted by someone else. The last item in the list is \u201camedhyam\u201d, which is food that cannot be offered to the deity for worship. He expects us to have the understanding to know what we can offer to the deity and what we should not.        So, having gone through the various characteristics of food in these three shlokas, what is the practical implication for us? The first step towards making our antaha karana saatvic, our intellect, our mind our thoughts saatvic, is to watch what we eat. If we are habituated to eating extremely spicy food, we will not have the stability of mind needed to make other parts of of life saatvic. By slowly adopting food that is predominantly saatvic, we lay the foundation for improving the texture of our entire personality."

Shri Krishna says that food which has sharp flavours, any food that is excessively bitter, sour, salty, spicy, pungent, dry or causes a burning sensation in the tongue and stomach, all this comes under the category of raajasic food. Now this does not mean all such food is to be avoided. We need to exercise caution when the proportion of these characteristics is \u201cati\u201d or excessive.        It is quite easy to assess the impact of such food in our system. Consumption of such food causes duhkha or pain, which begins with the mouth and hurts the entire digestive system for a long time. Such food can also have a long term impact on the body in the form of \u201caamaya\u201d or disease. Since the person has raajasic faith, he will have a strong preference for such type of food, and will feel sorrow if he is unable to obtain such food. In today\u2019s age, food that is high in sodium, sugar and oil also comes in this category.        Food, in its broader sense, also refers to the intake of information through the eyes and ears as well. Watching a lot of violent movies and TV, for instance, inflicts pain upon the mind. Many people get addicted to the internet and television, and experience sorrow if they are unable to log on or watch TV, even for a short while. It is no different than a bodily disease. In other words, the kind of television or internet content we consume can also reveal a lot about the texture of our faith."

It says that the food we eat is divided into three parts. Majority of what we eat is rejected by the body. The second part is used to build the bones, muscles, skin, organs and so on. The third part, the most subtle part goes into the antaha karana, comprising of the emotional mind, the intellectual mind, memory and senses. In other words, the food we eat impacts our personality in a  multitude of ways.        Shri Krishna says that the type of food we eat can point to the texture of our faith. He lists the characteristics of food that is consumed by a saatvic person. Saatvic food promotes aayu or longevity. It improves the quality of thoughts in our mind. It improves our strength and our health, since it provides essential nutrition to the body. We have happiness while we are eating it, and joy after we have eaten it. It does not cause any regrets while eating it, or after eating it.        What does such saatvic food taste like? It is juicy, like a succulent fruit. It is not dry, it has just the right amount of fat and oil, like almonds. It is stable, it provides long term benefits to the body, long after having consumed it. It is hridyaa which means pleasant. One does not have to cultivate a special taste for it since it is agreeable to all. Another meaning of hridyaa is medicinal. Such food can be digested easily when our power of digestion is low, and can also help in the healing process."

The principle here is to assess the attitude with which we perform actions. The type of attitude maintained while performing an action will reveal whether our faith is saatvic, raajasic or taamasic. Shri Krishna covers the entire spectrum of actions performed by us with just four categories: our intake of food, sacrifice, penance and charity. To better understand these categories, we need to understand the underlying symbolic meaning.        We have come across broader meaning of the term yajnya or sacrifice in karma yoga. It refers to any action or transaction with another person or object while adhering to our duty. If we are an accountant by profession, then earning a livelihood as an accountant becomes a yajyna or sacrifice. Next, tapas or penance is the means by which we conserve energy needed to perform our duties. A scientist will give up innumerable opportunities to party because he is performing an experiment in his lab in the night. This is penance. Daanam or charity refers to the donation of excess wealth accumulated while performing our duties. The act of charity helps reduce our level of lobha or greed.        The intake of food or aahaara is given its own category. It different than sacrifice, penance or austerity for a couple of reasons. Any action performed towards feeding the body gives its phala, its result, immediately. But any other type of action gives its result much later. Furthermore, the result of feeding our body is restricted to the body, not to anything or anyone else. That is why people who are very diligent in their duties can become lax in their dietary habits. Food is analyzed in great detail in the next three shlokas."

The very next day, we join a gym for the very first time, and spend one hour running on the treadmill. This will not be a good idea. Instead of helping our body, we may harm it. Weight loss, like any other system, requires a combination of knowledge and action. Unless we understand the techniques involved in weight loss, we should avoid starting an exercise regimen.        A similar state is found in some people who practice terrible austerities in the name of worship. Shri Krishna explains their fate here. He says that those who torture the body and mind in the name of austerity are doing nothing but weakening the elements, meaning the organs, in their body. Nowhere in the scriptures does it ask us to harm our body. He goes one step further by asserting that such people are also hurting Ishvara himself. As we saw in the ninth chapter, Ishvara dwells in all of us as the saakshi, the witness of our thoughts and actions.        Shri Krishna calls such people achetesaaha which means ignorant, or even unconscious. They chose to ignore Ishvara\u2019s teaching in the form of scriptures. They do not have faith in any ideal except their own preservation. They are driven only by egoism and desire. It is no wonder that their plans, their resolves, will be aasuric or devilish, as explained in the prior chapter. So the warning to us is clear. As we are conducting the analysis of our faith, we should in no way emulate these people. We should stay away from them."

Shri Krishna, teacher extraordinaire, uses this shloka and next to give us a warning before delving into the topic of analyzing the texture of our faith.        This warning is very simple. Any time we see people abuse and torture themselves or others in the name of devotion, physically or mentally, we need to stay away from such people. Or, in the rare chance that we have been misguided by someone to do such things, we should immediately stop. Such torture could be something as basic as denying oneself food and water to the detriment of one\u2019s health, or could be as terrible as poking and prodding oneself with pins and needles. None of this is sanctioned by any scripture.        So why would someone perform such painful austerities? Shri Krishna says many of these people have some misguided pride about some body-oriented feat such as walking on hot charcoals. They want to put on a show so that they can satisfy the urge of ostentation, to show off their feats. Some others become so attached a worldly goal that they take on vows of incessant fasting without taking their health into consideration. Broadly speaking, such people do not gain their result, and end up harming themselves and others around them."

Those that worship deities such as Lord Ganesha, Lord Shiva and so on are saatvic. Those that worship materialistic spirits or yakshas such as Kubera the lord of wealth are raajasic. Those that worship ghosts and demons are taamasic. Hearing this, we may say that we only worship deities. We never worship anything else. Therefore, we may conclude that we are highly saatvic individuals.        But as we have seen in karma yoga, the attitude with which we perform an action is equally important as the action itself. Imagine that three people visit the same temple at the same time and pray to the same deity. One person may pray because he wants his daughter to get married. One may pray to knock off his business competitor. Another may pray so that he attains liberation in this life. Outwardly, they may seem to be doing the same action, but there is a world of difference in their attitude. This difference in attitude is symbolically conveyed in the shloka using terms such as ghosts and demons.        So, analyzing our actions is not as easy as observing what we do. We also need to note our attitude behind our actions. As we saw earlier, our nature or svabhaava determines our attitude and our actions. To uncover the texture of our faith, we first need to uncover our attitudes and motivations, which requires a high degree of awareness. To get better and doing so, Shri Krishna covers a gamut of actions in this chapter so that we can practice observing our attitude as well as our actions, observe what we do and why we do it."

The human being is nothing but a bundle of faiths, also known as beliefs, prejudices, customs, culture, tradition, basically everything that is ingrained into us as samskaaraas or impressions. But where do these impressions come from? Some of these impressions come from external factors, and some of these are present in us right from our birth.        When we see a child prodigy perform a complicated symphony, we may say that she got this skill from non stop practice since her birth, or we may say that she got it from her practice in a previous life. In any case, her actions are a product of the samskaaraas or impressions formed through countless hours of practice.        Shri Krishna says that faith is according to one\u2019s sattva. Here, sattva is not used in its traditional meaning as a guna like rajas and tamas. Sattva refers to our svaabhaava, our nature, the bundle of impressions that are stored in our inner instrument, our antaha karana, which is comprised of our mind, intellect, memory and senses. This sattva, this bundle of impressions, makes us choose our actions throughout our lives. Although we think of ourselves as rational individuals, we use logic and reason to justify and rationalize our faith, in a roundabout way.        Now we come back to the question posed in the previous shloka. How can we assess the texture of our faith, our beliefs and our prejudices? We need to examine our actions. Our faith, our beliefs and our prejudices guide our actions. Therefore, by examining the texture of our actions, we can determine the texture of our faith. Our faith could be saatvic, raajasic or taamasic. Shri Krishna now takes each aspect of our actions and gives us guidelines on how to determine their texture."

If one does not have access to the scriptures but uses their faith to guide their lives, what kind of a position is that? Shri Krishna does not answer that question directly. The entire chapter, in fact, is the answer to that question.        It is not an easy question to answer because faith differs from person to person. We can say that we trust our faith, our conscience, to guide us towards performing right actions. But the faith of a terrorist is different than faith of a saint. If we do not have guru to guide us, we cannot assess our faith objectively. So how should we tackle this issue?        Shri Krishna gives us a starting point to help us. We first need to understand what he means when he says that faith comes from svabhaava or nature. What exactly is meant by nature here? Nature refers to the collection of samskaaraas or impressions that are present in a person, a \u201cdehin\u201d or embodied one, from birth until death. Whenever we perform an action and get its result, both the action and result are ingrained in our mind in the form of an impression. This impression is called as samskaara. Whenever we repeat the action and get the same result, the impression is further ingrained and strengthened. If we repeat it often enough, it becomes a habit. It could be a good habit such as respecting our elders, or a bad habit such as smoking.        So this nature, this collection of samskaaraas or impressions, is where our faith comes from. Now let\u2019s go back to Arjuna\u2019s question. In the absence of scriptures, in the absence of a rational, logical means to check our actions, what will happen if we use our faith instead? If someone swears loudly at us in the middle of the street, we will respond instinctively at that point rather than using logic or reason. We may punch the person who yelled at us, or we may ignore him. It depends on the makeup of our nature.        Now, based on the makeup of our nature, we can classify our faith into three types: saatvic, raajasic and taamasic. But it is difficult to do so directly. We will have to infer the nature of faith through something else. Shri Krishna tells Arjuna to listen, since he will explain how to do this."

This was the concluding message of the previous chapter. Hearing this, the word \u201cshaastra\u201d or scripture stuck in Arjuna\u2019s mind. Perhaps he foresaw that over the course of time, most people will not have access to scriptures. They will not be able to receive the guidance of a real guru who truly cares about their spiritual growth versus extracting money from them. He wanted to know, like all of us do, how to use our judgement without access to scriptural laws.        Let us now investigate what category of people Arjuna is speaking about. There are those who may have access to the scriptures, may even understand the scriptures, but have no inclination of following them. Such people were covered in the last chapter under the category of devilish qualities. Conversely, there are people who understand the scriptures and also conduct their life according to scriptures. These people were covered under the category of divine qualities. This chapter covers those people who do not have access to the scriptures, but yet try to lead their lives through faith, sincerity and honesty.          So then, Arjuna asks this extremely practical question on behalf of common people who have faith in some higher principle. Some may be devotees of Shri Krishna, some of Lord Shiva, some of Lord Ganesha. Some may not have faith in a deity but may have faith in a spiritual text such as the Gita. Some may have not have faith in any of these but may have faith in a friend, spouse or relative who has faith in a deity or a spiritual text. Some may have faith in their nation or in a higher cause such as improving the state of the nation\u2019s education system.        Regardless of what their faith is, such people would like to set themselves on a path that gains them happiness in the material world, and also enables them to pursue the supreme goal of self realization or liberation. In the absence of scripture as the authority, faith determines the course of action for such people. How can they determine whether their faith is saattvic, rajasic or tamasic? How can they ensure that their faith is leading them in the right direction?"

        "content": "The theme of the sixteenth chapter is the analysis of divine and devilish qualities that are present in every human being. Shri Krishna beings by listing all of the divine qualities such as fearlessness and purity of mind. He then provides a similar but brief list of devilish qualities such as ostentation and arrogance. He underscores the point that the divine qualities are a stepping stone towards self realization and liberation, but the devilish qualities are a slippery slope towards never-ending bondage and sorrow        Next, the philosophy of materialists is analyzed in great detail, because extreme materialism is considered no different than devilish nature. At its core, materialists do not believe in any overarching humanitarian laws or values, since they see the world as nothing but a combination of elements. Material gain is the sole aim of their lives. Anyone or anything that comes in their aim is a target for annihilation.        Shri Krishna says that such people are steeped in delusion and ignorance. Instead of bringing happiness, their infinite desires only bring them infinite worries. These infinite desires bind them and prod them to illegal and unethical means of accumulating wealth. What should I acquire next, whom should I harm next, this becomes their thinking. They develop extreme arrogance and pride towards their family, their wealth and their actions. They totally sever any association with whatever little values and conscience in them.        Such people never realize that by hating everyone they hate Ishvara who dwells in everyone and everything, who is the support of this creation. Although such people think that they are above all laws, they are not above the law of karma. They get the results of their actions in this life and several others to come. Caring only for themselves, they have begun behaving like animals even when they are human. Therefore they are cast into an endless cycle of births and deaths as animals, insects and other creatures.        Shri Krishna ends this chapter with an extremely practical message. He gives us a simple formula that will give us peace and happiness in this world, and also put us on a fast track to liberation. All we need to do is to avoid the three gates of hell which are desire, anger and greed. We do so by making scripture become the motivator and the prompter of our actionsm and not selfish desire."

He says that ultimately it is the prompter of our actions, our motivation, that determine whether we are behaving as divine entities or as devilish ones. If the prompter of our actions is selfish desire, we are heading in the wrong direction. If the prompter is scripture, we are heading in the right direction. Therefore, when in doubt, we should refer to the guidelines in the scriptures on the performance of actions.        A case in point is Arjuna\u2019s fundamental question: is it right to harm another individual? A soldier of the army defending his country and a gangster shooting at a crowd are performing the same action \u2013 killing people. But the difference is the prompter of both those actions. The soldier is prompted by duty to his country, whereas the gangster is prompted by greed. Where did the soldier\u2019s duty come from? We could say that it came from the army\u2019s code of conduct. We could say that it come from the constitution of his country. We could say that it came from the values cultivated by his parents.        In all these cases, the soldier\u2019s sense of duty came from a set of guidelines that were founded on something that was much larger than the narrow viewpoint of one individual, that kept the bigger picture in mind. This is what Shri Krishna refers to as scripture. Using the word \u201chere\u201d in the shloka, he reminds Arjuna that such intelligent living is only possible in a human birth, not in any other birth. Now, we come to an interesting question? Which authority, which scripture should one follow? In this day and age, how can one practically lead an intelligent life that follows a selfless set of guidelines, that follows a scripture? This intriguing question is tackled in the next chapter.        om tatsatiti shreematbhagavatgitasupanishadsu brahmavidyaayaam yogashaastre shreekrishnaarjunsamvade daivaasurasampadvibhaagayogo naama shodashodhyaayaha || 14 ||"

Most people will follow the instructions given in the manual that comes in the box. But, for some reason, lets say we ignore the manual and build what we want based on a whim. What will be the outcome? We will be unsuccessful in building a functional piece of furniture. Consequently, we will not be happy with this outcome. Without following the manual, we neither gain success nor attain happiness.        Shri Krishna says that if we live our lives based solely on our desires, we will neither attain success in any worldly endeavour, nor will we attain worldly happiness. The supreme goal of self realization then is totally out of the question. Unfortunately, whenever we feel disillusioned, we usually seek guidance from the latest self help book, or try to emulate the lives of those who have had significant material prosperity. Such guidance may get us temporary happiness in a small part of our life, but will never solve our predicament holistically.        So then, what is the solution? Shri Krishna points us to the Vedas, the scriptures, as a guide towards checking our selfish desire-oriented life. He is in no way advocating a dogmatic, ideological or blind faith oriented lifestyle that imposes restrictions upon society. The Gita, in fact, presents the very principles of the Vedas in a format that is meant for practical individuals. The notion of svadharma, of following a career path that is in line with our interests and our qualifications, is a perfect example of guidance from the scriptures."

From an absolute standpoint, such a person attains the supreme goal of self realization, of oneness with Ishvara, instead of entrapment in the never ending cycle of birth and death.        With this shloka, the message of the entire sixteenth chapter is summarized and concluded. Most of us, given the materialistic nature of the world, are on the path of preyas, the pleasant, the path of continuous satisfaction of selfish desires. Shri Krishna urges us to slowly tune down the three devilish qualities of desire, anger and greed, so that we can start walking on the path of shreyas or the auspicious, the path of the divine qualities. Only then do we become qualified to attain the supreme goal of self realization.        Having heard this, we probably have a question that arises in our minds. Every second of our lives, we are bombarded with a ton of desires. If our awareness level is high, we can regulate them some of the time, but not all of the time. Furthermore, anger can erupt and take over our mind within a microsecond. How can we, on our own, control desire, anger and greed? It is not easy. Anticipating this question, Shri Krishna answers it in the next shloka."

He says that we always need to watch out for these three qualities in our daily lives, and minimize them as much as possible. He calls them gateways into hell, because they lead to the path of destruction rather than the path of liberation. Even the order of these three is important, because both anger and greed follow desire.        The second chapter explained how kaama or desire comes into our lives. Dhyavato vishayaan, by constantly thinking of an object (or a person or a situation), we develop an association with it. If carried on for long, this association results in a desire to procure that object. If anyone or anything comes between us and the object, we develop anger. And once we have the object, once our desire is fulfilled, we want more of the object. This results in greed.        So then, how do we tackle these three gates of hell? Let us first look at kaama or desire. If desire develops through contemplation of objects, we can reduce desire to a certain extent by keeping a watch on what we expose our mind to. For example, we can go to the mall with a shopping list rather than wander around shops that we don\u2019t need anything from. But the root of desire is the labelling of objects as desirable by our mind. This labelling or superimposition is known as \u201cshobhana adhyaasa\u201d. It is why the same dress looks desirable to one person and irrelevant to another, since objects by themselves are not desirable. Controlling and convincing the mind through study of scriptures and meditation helps to reduce this labelling.        Desire is somewhat easy to control, but once we are in the grip of anger, it becomes somewhat difficult to do so. At least we do not publicly display our desires, but we do not hesitate to show our anger publicly. We require tremendous control over our mind in order to release ourselves from the grip of anger. It is therefore better to focus on rooting out unnecessary desires than to confront anger directly.        Lastly, lobha or greed can be kept in check through charity. Anytime we start feeling pride over our wealth or possessions, we should immediately donate a portion of our wealth or possessions. How exactly we should do so is covered in the next chapter."

Anyone who has attained a human birth has a chance to achieve self realization and liberation. But those individuals who engage in destruction of others instead of improving their state give up this golden opportunity. Such people enter a never ending descent into lower and lower realms of existence. An example given in most commentaries is that of kumbhipaaka, where individuals spend their time in a pot of boiling oil.        Such is the rare and special nature of a human birth, that most spiritual masters have mentioned it in their texts. Shankaraachaarya begins the Vivekachoodamani text with this proclamation : \u201cFor beings a human birth is hard to win, then manhood and holiness, then excellence in the path of wise law; hardest of all to win is wisdom. Discernment between Self and not-Self, true judgment, nearness to the Self of the Eternal and Freedom are not gained without a myriad of right acts in a hundred births\u201d.        The practical implication of this shloka is the importance of free will. Only a human has the ability to shape his or her destiny. Plants, animals and birds cannot do so. All they can do is follow their instincts and their sense organs. If we also start ignoring our intellect and empowering our sense organs, there remains no difference between us and animals. We lose all traces of sattva, and only exist through rajas and tamas."

Shri Krishna says that through their behaviour, such people become naraadhamaan, the lowest of the humans, the most wretched category of people in this world. They mistakenly think that they are above the law. But they are not above the law of karma. Ishvara ensures that such people get the punishment that they deserve, which is rebirth into devilish wombs such as those of animals and insects.        Let us first examine the symbolic meaning of this shloka. As we have seen in earlier chapters, we are at our best when the intellect has supremacy over our senses and our mind. But in people with devilish attributes, this picture becomes topsy turvy. The senses rule over the intellect. Logic, reason, duty, all such characteristics of the intellect are suppressed. Only sensual consumption takes precedence.        Now lets look at the shloka. Each time someone gives precedence to their senses as opposed to their intellect, their ego, their sense of I, ties yet another know, makes yet another association with the senses. Symbolically, each time this happens, they take birth in a devilish womb. This situation cannot carry on for a while. History is full of tyrants and dictators who let their greed get the better of them, made one miscalculation, and died horrible deaths at the hands of their subjects or their enemies.        Literally, this shloka asserts the working of the law of karma. Out of nowhere, we find that we experience unexpected professional success, monetary and personal gains. Similarly, we find that unexpectedly, we have to go through a rough, painful patch. Good or bad actions that we have performed in our present life, or perhaps in a previous life, always bring their consequences back to us. In fact, whenever we are going through a rough patch, we should be glad that the consequences of our bad actions are getting exhausted.        Similarly, people who commit devilish actions also get their payback. But their payback is harsher than what most of us go through. Shri Krishna says that such people take birth into species such as animals and insects. In such species, there is no scope for using the intellect to gain self realization and liberation. Only humans have this ability. Any state where we cannot access the intellect, whether we are in a human form or not, is the worst punishment possible."

The foremost devilish quality is egotism. Considering anything other than the eternal essence as the I is egotism. For most of us, the I is our body and mind. This incorrect understanding comes from avidyaa or ignorance of our true nature. In the Mahabhaarata, ignorance is symbolically represented by the blind king Dhritarashtra, and egotism by his first child Duryodhana, the cause of the Mahabhaarata war.        When egotism or the I notion is strong, one tends to impose one\u2019s will on others. This is balam or power. One tends to disregard one\u2019s duties, rules and norms, lose all sense of right and wrong, due to the strength of egotism. This is darpam or arrogance. Their primary aim of life becomes kaama or selfish desire, resulting in krodha or anger when these desires are not fulfilled. Other devilish tendencies such as hypocrisy, pride and ostentation are variations of these primary qualities. We should always be on the lookout for the rise of such qualities in us.        Shri Krishna goes on to say that such people hate Ishvara who dwells in everyone, including the very people who are harbouring these devilish qualities. They never listen to Ishvara who, as the voice of conscience, pleads them to not fall prey to these qualities. They do not follow the instructions of Ishvara as laid down in the scriptures. Instead, they resent him and hate him, as well as those who follow his path by cultivating divine qualities."

Such people put in a lot of effort to create the impression that they are always one step ahead with regards to wealth, power and achievements as compared to their rivals. Shri Krishna paints a picture of this game of one upmanship in this shloka. He examines how such people perform sacrificial rituals. Let us look at the broader meaning of the term sacrifice, which means any activity undertaken for the greater good of society, commonly termed social service.        For instance, imagine that an extremely materialistic individual, one who has devilish qualities, announces that he will build a school in an impoverished village. First of all, whether the individual is qualified to build a school or not does not matter. He will praise himself and claim that he is qualified. He will probably not take advice from others, given his stubborn nature. He will make a big announcement in the media, but the emphasis will be on the charitable qualities of the founder than of the school he is building.        When in year or so, the hype of the media has died down, and students start attending the school, all kinds of irregularities are discovered. The building construction is faulty. There is no proper budget for hiring good teachers. The money raised for this effort has been funnelled into questionable channels. In a nutshell, the entire effort has been conducted unsystematically, only for the temporary image enhancement of the founder in the media. As with the other scenarios we have seen in this chapter, the root of all this is the intoxication of wealth and fame."

Drug addiction begins when a person has some problem, discomfort or sorrow, such as a teenager finding it difficult to fit it or an adult losing his job. Using drugs or alcohol appears to solve the problem, so he uses them repeatedly. At this point, his body gets habituated to the drugs or alcohol and consequently shuts down all logic and reason. The person has become an addict. His sole aim in life is to do whatever it takes to satisfy his cravings.        Shri Krishna summarizes the lifecycle of a person with devilish tendencies, which looks worryingly similar to that of a drug addict. The person in question has an underlying sense of incompleteness or sorrow. Fulfilling a selfish desire, no matter how insignificant, gives him a temporary burst of joy. He wants to repeat this sensation, he wants more of it, and thus becomes addicted to desires and enjoyments. The more he does so, the more power he gives to his emotional mind, and takes power from his reasoning and intellect. He is trapped in the web of delusion. All he can think about now is more and more desires to fulfill, and the means to fulfill them.        Whether or not a drug addict or a highly materialistic person literally falls into hell is a different story. But a life of addiction, a life where inert substances make us dance to their tune, a life where there is no higher aim or goal, and most importantly, a life where the intellect has taken a backseat, is no different than any hell with fire and brimstone in it."

Here Shri Krishna describes the mindset of people who derive pride from other things such as wealth and family. An excess of wealth, especially for those who did not come from wealthy families, is the most common source of pride. Such people boast about their latest expensive toy, their net worth, their membership in elite clubs and so on. They are only interested in consumption and enjoyment.        Others derive pride from their ancestry and their lineage. For some, this pride comes from the fact that their ancestors were kings or landowners. For some, this pride comes from the fact that everyone in their family has always been a doctor or a lawyer. Some others even boast about the number of sacrifices they have conducted and amount of charity they have donated. Instead of charity and sacrifice leading to purification of one\u2019s mind, such grandiose spectacles have gaining publicity and favours as their goal.        If we were to summarize the attitude in these three shlokas, it is this \u2013 no one is equal to me. I am superior to everyone else. So the net result is the strengthening, the hardening of the I notion, the ego, the aham. Each step taken towards the ego is one step taken away from self realization.

So then, any person who becomes an obstacle to the fulfillment of a desire automatically becomes an enemy. For instance, if another business becomes a competitor to our business, we begin to treat them as enemies instead of improving our products. That leads to all kinds of unethical and illegal ways of getting rid of our competitors, all the way upto physical harm.        Now, many people rise to political power by knocking off their competitors. They begin to think they are above the law. And since they do not believe in god, they think that they themselves are gods, and that only they can control the fate of people. They can take the law into their own hands, because they believe they are the lawmakers. Pleasure and enjoyment is their only goal. Such is the thinking of gangsters, military dictators and criminals. In the Raamaayana, Ravaana began to think like this, leading to his downfall.        Other materialistic people may not necessarily become dictators, but try to project their power and arrogance wherever possible. They say things like they can pick up the phone and call the president of the country. They have accomplished everything there is to accomplish. There is no one mightier than them. They mistake this sense of power for happiness, because they have not experienced what real happiness is. Even a simple act of name dropping indicates a deeper obsession with materialism and power."

Once I get through my gruelling 4 year engineering course, I will be happy. As the 4 years come to a close, another desire comes in. I need to get into a good masters program in the US. When that happens, he feels that he will he happy when he gets a US visa. Once he arrives in the US, he wants a green card. Then he wants a wife, a big house, car and so on. Each time he thinks he will be happy, another desire is waiting in line to be fulfilled.        Shri Krishna wants us to examine our own outlook and find out the level of materialism in it. So in this shloka and the following two shlokas, he uses the first person to drive this point home. Here, he wants us to inquire into what we think is our ultimate goal, our destination, our objective in life. Most of us will come to a similar conclusion that it is accumulation of wealth so that we can take care of our material desires as well as those of our family.        But this line of thinking has a flaw in it. Desires are bahushaakha, they multiply infinitely, as we have seen in earlier chapters. Each desire contains the seed of several other desires. If any of those desires is unfulfilled, we invite stress, tension and anxiety into our lives. Now it does not mean that we should not harbour any desires. It just means that we need to apply some system, some framework to ensure that desires are managed and do not get out of hand.        The four stage aashrama system (brahmachaari, grihastha, vaanaprastha and sanyaasi) prescribes the duties of an individual based on their stage in life. When duties are given importance, desires automatically manage themselves. For instance, if one is a householder, then one focuses on what is the essential set of desires for fulfilling one\u2019s duties, rather than deriving joy out of adding more and more desires. And even if some desires are unfulfilled, they do not agitate the mind because the goal is the duty, not the desire."

It is as if a paasha, a lasso, a rope is tied around us on one end, and the desire on the other. Just like a cowboy puts a lasso around a horse and makes it obey his instructions, each desire makes us into a slave, makes us dance to its tune.        If this is our plight, what to talk of highly materialistic individuals.They have not one but hundreds of such ropes to bind them. If one desire is fulfilled, they have several others waiting in line. If a desire does not get fulfilled, it generates anger and agitation, causing them to inflict harm and pain upon themselves and upon others. They fall into a vicious cycle of desire, anger and greed which, given that they subscribe only to a materialistic viewpoint, is almost impossible to get out of.        So if one is continually plagued by hundreds of desires, and has a narrow outlook towards the world, what is his solution? It is money, it is accumulation of wealth, artha sanchaayan. But, in order to fulfill the infinite desires that are pulling him in several directions, there arises a need to generate wealth beyond what is legally and ethically possible. Therefore, he resorts to making money using any means necessary, legal or illegal."

Now, Shri Krishna shows how they cause harm to themselves as well. He says that those devilish individuals, those with aasuri sampatti do not have even a single moment of peace. Their mind is always agitated with an infinite number of anxieties and worries. This state of affairs, this constant state of tension never ends, it goes on all the way till the end of their life.        Every selfish desire comes pre-packaged with the seed of anxiety. Why is this so? In anyone\u2019s life, there will always be one desire or another that remains unfulfilled. It is quite normal. But when we give the utmost importance to desire and consumption, when we make it the ultimate goal of life, our mind is in a constant state of agitation until each desire is fulfilled. And even if we have all the wealth and power in the world, there will always be something that we are missing, which will in turn generate anxiety.        But if our worldview incorporates something higher, if we seek a higher goal than goes beyond materialism, we expand our sense of self, our sense of I. Instead of only thinking about our own well being, we start caring about our family, our parents, our city, our nation and so on. Now it does not matter if we have to undergo any suffering, because we care about something that is higher than us. The culmination of this expansion of self happens when we begin to have faith in the highest self, Ishvara, the faith that he will ensure our well being. Consequently, our anxiety about our well being begins to diminish."

People who follow the materialistic world view believe that one who is without selfish desires is as good as dead. They do not believe that selfless action, work that benefits someone other than themselves, is worth anything.        This greed propels them to dambhaha or pretentiousness. They do not see the harm in putting on a show in order to gain favours or get what they want. As they accumulate more wealth and power, they feed their superiority complex, resulting in maanaha or excessive pride. When their pride reaches greater and greater heights, they become drunk with their ill-gotten accomplishments and possessions. This is mada, intoxication.        We keep coming back to the theme of ignorance and delusion, of moha, when we analyze the materialistic world view. When one cannot tell right from wrong, one begins to develop views that are not based on truth or rationality, termed in the shloka as moha-asat. It is no surprise that the activities or undertakings of such people are impure, lawless, without any consideration of duty or the big picture. Defrauding others or destroying others property are illegal in the eyes of the law, but perfectly legal from their standpoint."

In other words, they did not have any regard for the consequences of their actions, especially when it came to harming others. Such people are the embodiment of the aasuric or the devilish tendencies.        Shri Krishna now begins to describe such people in great detail. First, he says that such people hold a petty, narrow minded view of the world. If I win, someone has to lose, this is their outlook. They have no sense of connectedness, nothing in common with anyone else. They are nashthaatmaanaha, they are lost souls. They have no concept that there is something beyond the physical body, whether it is god, soul, humanity, nationality, nothing at all.        Now when such people don\u2019t have any connection with other human beings, with the rest of the world, they have no qualms in engaging in acts of terror. We nowadays come across people who create and deploy computer viruses, bombs, chemical weapons and so on. It all begins with a seemingly simple notion \u2013 that the body is the only truth in this world, and that everything is justified in preserving one\u2019s body at the expense of someone else\u2019s."

In the fifteenth chapter, Shri Krishna described his worldview by answering all these questions. Here, he proceeds to describe the materialistic worldview, the worldview of the asuras, those with devilish qualities.        At its core, the materialistic viewpoint views everything as comprised of the five elements, or in today\u2019s times, atoms and molecules. So then, the answer to the questions, who am I, and what is the cause of this world, is the same. I am nothing but a combination of the five elements, and the world is also nothing but a combination of the five elements. Both are caused by the union of elements, either through chemical or biological reactions that happen due to forces of attraction, forces of desire.        Now, if the world is comprised of nothing but inert matter, one will concluded that there is no truth to it, no basis to it, nothing higher to it. A divide starts to arise between the I and the world. If the world is an inert, unreal entity, why should I treat it with care? Anything, including lying, cheating and murder, is then justified. Materialists go one step further and assert that there is no governing principle in this world, no god. So I can get away with whatever I want, because there is no law."

He says that those people who come from a purely materialistic viewpoint have a shaky value system. In other words, they do not know what to do and what not to do, when to engage in something and when not to. They focus only on artha or wealth and kaama or desire. They forget that there are two other goals in life, dharma or duty and moksha or liberation, and that each goal is to be picked up and left off at a certain stage in life.        Now, since such people are unclear about the pros and cons of everything, they are bound to do things in a haphazard and messy way. Shri Krishna says that such people do not have shaucha, they do not have purity. He refers not just to external purity but also internal. When someone does not have a systematic way of thinking through things, there is a strong chance that they will lead messy lives. Furthermore, their conduct towards others, their aacharana, will also be messy and haphazard. They will lack good manners, courtesy and politeness.        It also follows that when someone does not know the pros and cons of anything, they will not place a lot of importance on satyam, truth, doing things the right way. So if they do not get the result they want, they have no qualms in getting their results by lying, cheating and deceit. They do not want to wait for the result, because waiting takes time. If there is a shortcut, they will go for it. Such is the value system of the aasuri, the devilish, the materialistic viewpoint."

Knowing this, Shri Krishna proceeded to describe the devilish qualities in detail in this chapter.        From our perspective, we are always struggling between progressing on the spiritual journey versus conforming to the prevalent way of life \u2013 materialism. While there is nothing inherently wrong with enjoying whatever life has to offer, society urges us sometimes to get carried away with the pursuit of materialism, without pointing out the downside of doing so. It is instructive to see how little has changed between the materialistic worldview of Shri Krishna\u2019s time and the present day.        So, from the next shloka to the end of this chapter, Shri Krishna paints a detailed picture of the materialistic world view that many of us have taken for granted. He describes the way they think and feel, their attitude towards people and objects, and the consequences of their materialistic viewpoint."

Shri Krishna now connects this chapter with the aim of the Gita. He says that we can increase the chances of our success in the spiritual path if we cultivate the divine qualities listed in this chapter, while toning down our devilish qualities. In today\u2019s day and age, it is easy to misunderstand some of these devilish qualities as essential for our survival, that without these qualities we will not get ahead in life. but it is not so.         For instance, take the quality of krodha or anger. Whenever we are in a state of anger, our intellect, our power of reasoning shuts down, as described in the second chapter. Our emotional mind takes over, and makes us perform actions that may harm us in the long run. Therefore, each time we get angry, we weaken our intellect, which is the one faculty that differentiates us from animals, and can take us closer to liberation. Akrodha, the divine quality of keeping our anger in check, prevents this from happening. We have to also keep in mind that we have to conduct self analysis and not apply this teaching to judge some other person.        Shri Krishna also anticipates a question arising in Arjuna\u2019s mind. Arjuna would have thought, am I in the divine qualities camp or in the other one. To this end, Shri Krishna consoles Arjuna. He asserts that Arjuna was always endowed with divine qualities, and that those qualities will most definitely lead him towards liberation. He addresses him as Paandava, to remind him that he comes from a lineage that has always demonstrated these divine qualities."

Asuras are portrayed as fearsome demons with long teeth and horns in comic books and TV shows. But the word asura means one who places sense enjoyment as his highest goals. Any ordinary looking human being can be an asura, if he constantly dwells in sense pleasures.        Projecting an image of ourselves to be larger, to be different than what we really are  dambaha. There are people who portray themselves to be smarter, wiser and accomplished than they really are. Or, there are others who cover up their misdeeds by portraying themselves as god fearing and so on. Broadly speaking, such people try to change what they have through cover-up rather than work hard and perform actions that will give them better results.        Darpa refers to arrogance and pride over our possessions, and the subsequent putting down of others who may not have what we have. These people not only hurt others by their insults, they hurt themselves as well. Instead of weakening their notions of me and mine, which become obstacles to spiritual growth, such people strengthen them. Krodha refers to anger. Specifically, it is the thought that gives a kind of satisfaction after having yelled at someone who has wronged us, instead of the thought that wants to solve a concern, or to help that other person.        Next, Shri Krishna mentions paarushyam, which means insolence or harshness, as a diabolical quality. Harshness can occur at the body and speech level. Elbowing our way to the front of a crowded line is harshness at the body level. Using bitter and taunting language is harshness at the speech level. Pointing out someone\u2019s faults in front of everyone is harshness at the speech level.        The primary devilish quality is that of ajnyaanam or ignorance. From a day to day standpoint, not knowing which action is right versus which action is to be avoided, this is ignorance. Chasing momentary pleasures in the material world without regards to actions and consequences constitutes ignorances. From an absolute standpoint, it is the ignorance of our true nature as existence, awareness and joy that is the fundamental devilish quality."

Tejaha refers to brilliance that comes to dedicated seekers. Energy that is normally wasted through relentless contact with sense objects is conserved when we control our sense organs. Tapaha, conservation of energy, results in tejaha. Even if we control our food cravings for a short period of time, we will feel an influx of additional energy that will radiate out of our body.        A long term vow of never to get angry in the first place is termed kshamaa, which means forgiveness. If we feel someone has hurt us in any way, we want to punish him in the future. But when we forgive someone on the spot, we do not leave room for grudges to accumulate in our mind, cutting the very root of this attitude of punishment. The way to do this is to not expect any joy or sorrow from anyone or anything.        Next, we come across dhritihi which means fortitude. There will be situations in our life when our mind, body and senses will reach their breaking point. We will begin to say \u2013 I cannot take it anymore. The ability to keep holding on to our goal in the face of such fatigue is called dhritihi. It can only come out of training our mind to follow the direction of the intellect. This topic is covered in great detail in the eighteenth chapter.        Shaucham refers purity and cleanliness. External cleanliness, which means keeping our body, our surrounding and our environment clean is a given. But shaucham also refers to internal purity, which refers to keeping our mind and intellect free of likes, dislikes and attachments. Getting rid of the most stubborn dirt of the mind, ignorance of our true nature, is the highest act of cleaning we can perform.        The next quality Shri Krishna mentions is that of adroha. Here, we do not have any notion of hatred or enmity towards anyone. Droha actually means betrayal. It is the feeling of revenge we harbour against someone who we believe has wronged us, has betrayed us. Adroha means not to harbour such feelings. When one\u2019s goal is the supreme, they will never stoop to harbour feelings of revenge against anyone.        Maanitaa refers to the notion of always demanding respect from our peers. Atimaanitaa refers to extreme arrogance, of always demanding respect from our superiors. It comes from an inflated sense of self worth, by giving emphasis to our individuality. Naatimaanita is the opposite of atimaanitaa. As our sense of individuality merges into Ishvara through constant spiritual practice, qualities that are associated with an exaggerated ego or self worth automatically correct themselves.        Shri Krishna concludes the list of divine qualities in this shloka. Very few people are born with all these qualities. So even if we focus on cultivating a handful of these qualities within ourselves, we would have made a good start."

Ahimsaa refers to non violence, harmlessness, to not injure anyone intentionally or unintentionally. Harm to others need not be caused by weapons all the time. Most likely, we cause the most harm to others through action and speech. Any time we harbour dvesha or resentment towards someone else, we not only cause harm to our mind but also create a barrier to access Ishvara within.        Next comes satyam or truthfulness. The Mundaka Upanishad says \u201csatyam eva jayati\u201d, truth alone prevails, which is also found on the seal of the Indian government. Speaking the truth is considered the highest dharma. But truth should also be communicated thoughtfully. It should be priyam or dear, not a harsh sounding truth. It should be hitam, which means it should benefit the other person. It should also be nitam, brief, short and sweet.        Akrodhaha refers to absence of anger or rage in particularly challenging situations. If someone instigates us, for example honking a horn at the traffic signal, it is difficult not to get upset. We have to learn how to keep an anger in check, especially when we know that it is our natural tendency to get upset whenever a tough situation comes up. This does not meet that we remain meek. It means that we can keep our cool while demonstrating our anger to get a certain objective done, just like a snake can hiss without actually biting anyone.        Tyaagaha refers to renunciation, it means to give up. In daanam or charity, we donate our possessions to someone else. In tyaaga, we just give up our possessions. For instance, food can be given up to someone, this is daanam. But the notion that I won\u2019t eat food, this is tyaaga. At the highest level, we need to renounce our sense of I, our individuality. This is because all possessions, everything that we term as mine, are nothing but upaadhis or conditionings. The fewer conditionings that we identify with, the lesser will be our individuality. So we give up the sense of mine in daanam, but we give up our sense of I in tyaaga.        The next divine quality is that of shaantihi which means tranquility or calmness. This refers to the quietening of our antahakarana, of the mind, body and intellect. Even a tiny little thought of like and dislike can agitate our antahakarana, just like a speck of dust can agitate our eyes. So just as we are careful to not let anything enter our eyes, we should train ourselves to keep our antahakarana calm. Without calmness, progress on the spiritual path is not possible.        Apaishunam refers to the absence of slander, to not find faults in others, to not gossip about others. A simple policy to follow is to not agitate others, and to not be agitated by others. Unfortunately, many of us can agitate others without even knowing it. A seemingly harmless statement that we make about someone can balloon out of proportion and cause extreme distress to that person. It is usually best to not indulge in gossip.        Next we come across dayaa bhuteshu, which means compassion for all beings. It is the ability to relate to others when they are suffering. By being compassionate towards others, we acknowledge the unity of our self, of our I with someone else\u2019s I. It does not mean we have to shed tears each time we encounter someone with sorrow. It means that we can put ourselves in someone else\u2019s shoes and see their point of view.        Aloluptvam is the ability to check our sense organs when they are near their favourite objects. Damaha, the ability to control our sense organs, is directly related to this quality. Let\u2019s say we have decided not to each chocolates today. This vow will be tested if someone leaves a giant box of chocolates on our desk. The power of the sense organs is so strong that we will realize that we have consumed chocolates only after the fact. So the ability to prevent triggers from breaking our self control is called aloluptvam.        Maardavam means mridutaa or gentleness. It is the opposite of harshness. It is a measure of how soft, how tender one\u2019s heart it. This is why children approach their mothers for requests rather than their fathers. Hreehi refers to modesty, the ability to discern between acceptable versus unacceptable behavior, between what is right and what is wrong. Finally, achapalataa is absence of fickleness. Many of us lack the ability to sit still. Our hands and legs are always moving or twitching. Or, we tend to speak when not needed, or let our eyes wander all over. All these are signs that we are not in control of our actions"

This chapter is one of the more practical chapters in the Gita, and picks up on a statement made in the ninth chapter where three types of people \u2013 divine, devilish and evil. It describes two sets of qualities, divine and devilish, so that we can do an assessment of where we stand, to understand which qualities to tone down and which qualities to emphasize.        Shri Krishna says that the first divine quality is abhayam or fearlessness. Once we realize that the universe is a play of Ishvara\u2019s Prakriti, and our role in it is to exhaust or desires, we automatically develop fearlessness. We are even able to be fearless of death, the greatest fear, because we have understood that death applies to the body, not to the self. Another source of fear is loss or harm caused to our property and our relationships. If we remove the label of mine from everything, and recognize that everything is Ishvara\u2019s, fear automatically goes away.        The next quality is sattva samshuddhi, purity of mind. Sattva here refers to the antahakarana, the mind and the senses, because they are created from the sattva aspect of Prakriti. The foremost indication of a pure mind is the absence of any thought of cheating someone else, or cheating oneself. Even if we know that someone has done something wrong, we should tactfully deal with the situation, without putting them on the spot, or by making fun of them.        Let\u2019s now look at what is meant by jnyaanam or knowledge. True knowledge is knowledge of our own self, the answer to the question who am I. This knowledge is passed on from teacher to student through detailed study and analysis of the scriptures. Also, yoga refers to any process that connect us to something higher. So then, the third quality of jnyaana yoga avasthithi refers to the process of internalizing this knowledge by withdrawing the sense organs and mind from the play of the world, and constantly abiding in this knowledge.        We have seen how the notion that something is mine or something is my property can become a hinderance in the spiritual journey. An easy way to counter this notion of mine-ness is to engage in daanam or charity, the fourth quality. Whenever we feel that our pride in our possessions is increasing, we should examine where it is coming from, and weed out the source of our pride though charity. However, charity cannot be performed haphazardly. We have to put a lot of thought into what we are giving, how we are giving, when we are giving and so on. This is covered in great detail in the seventeenth chapter.        Another obstacle in the spiritual journey is the importance we give to our sense organs. They are kept in check by the fifth quality which is damaha or sense control. The natural tendency of the sense organs is to demand objects that are pleasant to them, but probably not beneficial to our personality as a whole. The tongue wants unhealthy foods, for instance. But it is important to note that like anything else, moderation is prescribed rather than complete denial, which has its own problems.        The sixth divine quality is that of yajnya, a topic that was covered elaborately in the fourth chapter. Essentially, it means that our dealings with the world should be performed thoughtfully. We owe our daily existence to our teachers, our deities, our environment, our ancestors, our fellow human beings and to nature. The payoff of these debts gave rise to the five types of yajnyas that are prescribed in the scriptures. The culmination of the spirit of yajnya is the giving up of our sense of I, our identity, to Ishvara.        For most children, and even for adults, studying is a boring and dreadful exercise, something to be dispensed off quickly. But Shri Krishna says that studying of the Gita, the Vedas, the Puraanas, any spiritual text, is an essential quality of the seeker. The emphasis is on the word self, which has two implications. We should be forced to study by someone else. The inspiration should come from within. Also, we should perform introspection, and not use the teaching to analyze and improve other people.        Tapaha or penance and austerity is the eighth divine quality. Austerity is not to be taken literally where one retires into the jungle and shuns all worldly duties. It refers to the fulfilling of one\u2019s duties while staying firm in the face of any obstacles, and by not wasting time and energy at the level of body, mind or intellect. Doing so requires patience and tact, but the payoff is the buildup of a reservoir of energy that can be channelized for spiritual pursuits. Further details on the various types of tapaha are found in the seventeenth chapter.        The ninth divine quality is aarjavam or straightforwardness. It refers to those who mean what they say and say what they mean. Their actions, speech and thought are aligned. There is no hint of crookedness or deceit in their dealings. It should be construed as being overly simple in a negative sense. Whenever we notice that we have strayed from this quality, it usually means that selfishness has entered into our system, and we need to correct it."

        "content": "The fifteenth chapter of the Bhagavad Gita is unique in several respects. It is the shortest, with only twenty shlokas. On the other hand, it summarizes the entire essence of not just the Gita but also all the Vedas in those twenty shlokas. Specifically, it covers four topics that are at the essence of any spiritual scripture: what is the world, who am I, what is God or what transcends the world and me, and what is the relationship between me, the world and God.        The chapter first addresses the nature of the world. Our existence in this world is illustrated using an upside down tree, similar to a family tree. The root of this tree is Ishvara wielding the power of Prakriti, the saguna brahman, the eternal essence with attributes. Samsaara, our existence on this world, is the outward growth of this tree. This growth is fueled by sense objects which are in the form of sprouts or buds. Each sense object generates desires, which generates actions, which bind us to the branches of the tree.        The only way to rid ourselves of this endless cycle of desire and action is to cut the tree using the weapon of dispassion. The best way to cultivate dispassion is to go straight to the source of the tree, to take refuge in Ishvara. A seeker who wants to do so needs a list of qualifications such as freedom from pride and delusion. Only then will the seeker reach the abode of Ishvara, which is the state of self realization and liberation.        Next, the chapter addresses the state of the jeeva, the individual soul, the \u201cI\u201d. From an absolute standpoint, there is one eternal essence, one consciousness, one self, one \u201cI\u201d. But just like space seems like it is divided into many through walls, this eternal essence is as though divided into multiple \u201cI\u201d\u2019s through apparent limitations or upaadhis.        By attaching itself to upaadhis of the mind and the sense organs, an illusory self is created that imagines itself to be the jeeva, the individual soul. It takes up a new human body to exhaust the desires in its mind, but unfortunately picks up new desires and takes up yet another human body once the old one ceases to function. Only those individuals who have the eye of wisdom, who have assimilated the teaching of the scriptures after purifying themselves with karma and bhakti yoga, recognize the non-divided nature of the self. All others are living in delusion.        The third topic, the nature of God or Ishvara, is taken up next. We learn that Ishvara is not some remote figure, but pervades every aspect of the universe. Ishvara provides awareness or  the faculty to know. He provides energy through the sun, the moon and fire. This energy is circulated throughout the universe in the form of Soma or nectar, and also used for medicinal purposes. Metabolism, the faculty to extract energy from this food in the form of Soma, is manifested through Ishvara as the Vaishvaanara fire. Ultimately, all memory and knowledge is possible through Ishvara who is resides in the hearts (intellect) of everyone.        The fourth topic deals with relationship between the individual, the world, and God. If we trace the energy source of a tiny mango sapling, and of a 100 megawatt solar power plant, we reach the same source \u2013 the sun. Similarly, if we mentally remove the apparent limitations, the upaadhis, the names and forms behind the individual, the world and of Ishvara, we find the foremost person, the Purushottama, the pure unadulterated eternal essence. It is beyond the perishable visible world and the imperishable seed of the visible world which is Prakriti.        In other words, we learn that the \u201cI\u201d in us is the \u201cI\u201d in everyone, the self of all."

Some people say that they have still so many desires, so many plans to fulfill, that\u2019s why they cannot retire. Other people say that they still have so much to learn from the world, so much knowledge to acquire. Shri Krishna concludes this chapter by asserting that one who has truly understood the teaching of this chapter has accomplished whatever anyone can accomplish in this world, plus he has also known whatever can be known in this world.        Why does he say that whatever has to be known has been covered in this chapter? The highest knowledge to be known in this world is the understanding of three topics. What is the nature of the individual soul (who am I), what is this world and where did it come from, and what is beyond this world (is there a God). Any text that conclusively answers these three questions is termed a shaastra, a science. The fifteenth chapter of the Gita does so, and hence it is worthy of being termed a shaastra.        The method used to reveal Purushottama, the pure eternal essence, is to gradually move from the tangible to the intangible, from the visible to the subtle, from the visible universe to the invisible Prakriti to Purushottama who is beyond both. This method is known as Arundhati nyaaya, the technique of revealing the location of the star known as Arundhati. Here the teacher first points to a tree, then to one of its branches, then to one of its leaves, and then to the star that is right next to the tree. Without doing this step by step revelation, it would not have been possible to reveal the position of the star.        So then, the teaching of this chapter is called the foremost secret. It is secret because such knowledge is not accessible to any of these sense organs. It has to be revealed through a teacher who has had direct experience of the eternal essence. Furthermore, it has to be taught to a student who is straightforward and without sin like Arjuna. Shri Shankaraachaarya goes so far as to say that this chapter summarizes the teachings of all of the Vedic scriptures."

Anyone who entered it would see a whole army of their own selves due to the mirrors reflecting back and forth indefinitely. A dog entered this tent, saw an infinite number of dogs that looked like him, was afraid and started barking in fear. A passerby went in to see what was going on. Now when he saw himself in those infinite reflections, he thought to himself \u2013 I see myself everywhere, how nice this is!        Shri Krishna says that when we see our \u201cI\u201d as no different from anyone or anything else, when we do not pay attention to the name and form but to the self or aatmaa that is the basis of all name and form, that is the correct way of knowing Purushottama, the foremost person. Any other way of conceptualizing Purushottama or the eternal essence will involve some degree of delusion, some trace of name and form involvement. Worship of Ishvara as a deity with name and form is an essential step in the direction of realizing the Purushottama who is beyond all name and form.        When one reaches this conclusion of one\u2019s spiritual journey, there is nothing else left to be known in this world. Such a person becomes sarvavit, all knowing. He will develop sarvaatma bhaava, he will see himself in everything and everyone. So then, no matter the viewpoint, whatever angle, whatever pursuit he will undertake after this knowledge, it will be in worship of this Purushottama. This is the grand message of the Bhagavad Gita."

Therefore, in the world and in the Vedas, I am well known as the foremost person.        yasmaat : forksharam : perishableateetaha : transcendaham : Iaksharaat : imperishableapi : alsocha : anduttamaha : superior toataha : thereforeasmi : I amloke : in the worldvede : in Vedascha : andprathitaha : well knownpurushottamaha : foremost person        Now, Shri Krishna reveals his true identity as Purushottama, the uttama Purusha, the foremost person, which is a poetic means of referring to the eternal essence, the pure brahman without any limitations. The root of the sanskrit word \u201cuttama\u201d is \u201cut\u201d or high. This means that there is nothing higher than Purushottama. The imperishable, also known as Prakriti or Maaya, could be considered superior to the perishable world, because Prakriti is the cause and the world is its effect. Any cause is superior than its effect, just like the parents are superior to their children. Since Prakriti exists only as an adhyaasa, a projection on Purushottama, he is greater than anything else.        Let us also look at the significance of Purushottama by going deeper into what is meant by cause and effect. According to Vedanta, there are two types of causes. The material cause is the substance which makes the effect. A clay pot is made of clay, so its material cause, its upaadaana kaarana, is clay. But the pot did not make itself. There was an intelligence in the form of a potter that created the clay pot. This is the second type of cause is the nimitta kaarana, known as the intelligent or efficient cause.        Some schools of thought assert that the Purushottama is only the intelligent cause and not the material cause. He is like the potter who is distinct and separate than his creation. But in the Advaita school, the Purushottama is not only considered the intelligence behind creation, he is also the raw material behind the creation. The Mundaka Upanishad compares Purushottama to the spider who weaves the web from within himself, and eventually, pulls back the web into himself.        We should again not forget that this uttama Purusha, this foremost person, is nothing but our own self, our \u201cI\u201d. In fact, uttama Purusha in Sanskrit grammatically means the first person, the \u201cI\u201d. He is beyond the perishable tree of samsaara, and also beyond the seed of this tree in the form of Prakriti. What is the result of knowing this uttama Purusha? We will see in the next shloka."

Let us now pose the question \u2013 what is the core, what is the essence of these complex worlds? What is the purest state of these worlds? We need to peel the layers of an onion, as it were. The worlds are not real, they are created by a computer program. A computer program is not real, it is a series of instructions in a computer\u2019s memory. The instructions are not real, they are modifications of electricity. Ultimately, it is electricity that is creating and sustaining all of the worlds we see in a computer game.        Now, what if we pose the question \u2013 what is at the core of this world? If we get rid of all the limitations, what the purest state of this world? What is the purest state of our existence? The visible world is not real, because it is created by a play of the gunaas of Prakriti, and is perishable. Prakriti or Maaya is not real, though it is relatively imperishable, because it can be destroyed upon removal of our ignorance. What remains, is the eternal essence on which Maaya projects all its limitations or upaadhis.        Similarly, if we mentally remove our upaadhis or limitations, it will go something like this. Our body is a play of the gunaas, it is not real. Beyond the body are the senses and the mind, and they are comprised of gunaas and therefore not real. Beyond the senses and mind lies the eternal essence, untainted by Prakriti, which is the purest form of our \u201cI\u201d. In other words, when we remove all of our upaadhis or limitations, we come to the same eternal essence that is reached when we remove the upaadhis of the visible world.        We had seen the identity of our \u201cI\u201d with the eternal essence, of aatman with brahman, in the thirteenth chapter as well. That very same eternal essence, the purest brahman or shuddha brahman is referred to as the imperishable lord in this shloka by Shri Krishna. The three worlds here refer to either heaven, earth and hell, or even our waking, dreaming and sleeping states. The eternal essence enters and sustains all of them, but it is not some remote entity. It is the supreme self, the \u201cI\u201d residing within everyone."

What is interesting is that the same computer game can create a different world each time, with different kinds of aliens in different place. In other words, the infinitely complex virtual worlds created by the game can change, but the computer game program remains the same. Our visible universe is quite similar.        Shri Krishna begins to summarize the teaching of this chapter by asserting that everything in the world can be classified into two category. The first category comprises the visible world, the tangible world which comprises all living and inert beings. The second category comprises the invisible entity called Maaya. Maaya is like the computer game program that is invisible, yet has the power to create infinitely complex universes over and over again. The first category is termed kshara or perishable, because the universe has a beginning and end. The second category is termed akshara or imperishable, because it outlives the perishable.        So therefore, let\u2019s examine this teaching from two standpoints. From our standpoint, the standpoint of the \u201cI\u201d \u2013 the kshara, the perishable is our physical body. The akshara, the imperishable is the jeeva, as defined in the previous shlokas. From the standpoint of the world, the standpoint of the \u201cthat\u201d \u2013 the kshara is the visible universe. The akshara refers to Maaya, the seed of infinite universes, present, past and future.         Let\u2019s now look at some of the terms used in the shloka. Koota means illusion, and therefore kootastha means that which can create several illusions. Another clarification is around the imperishability of Maaya. If Maaya is imperishable, how can we get out of it? The answer is that Maaya is imperishable till we realize our true nature and attain liberation. Each category is called a Purusha or a being because both of them are limitations or upaadhis of Ishvara, as we shall see in the next shloka."

We crave knowledge in all its forms \u2013 knowledge of the material world, how things work, history, geography, sciences and the arts. We also crave that knowledge which is not tangible but is part and parcel of our lives \u2013 aspirations, values, codes of conduct and so on. Shri Krishna says that he is both the producer and consumer of knowledge in our lives. The sum total of all knowledge is referred to as the Vedas in this shloka.        The assimilation of knowledge goes through three steps. In the first step, we do not know anything, this is the state of apohanam, absence of memory. Next, we know something, knowledge happens, this is jnyaanam. Finally, this knowledge is stored in memory, this is smritihi. All these steps towards the acquisition of knowledge happen due to Ishvara, who is seated in our intellect, poetically referred to as hridi or intellect. So whenever we learn something new, or we recall something from our memory, we should understand that Ishvara is functioning as the subject and the object, the knower and the known, in this process of knowledge acquisition.        But that is not all. The ultimate knowledge, the entire theme of the Bhagavad Gita, is that knowledge which reveals the true nature of the self and its identity with Ishvara. It is handed down from a teacher to a student through tradition. It is found in the end, the conclusion, the anta of the Vedas. Therefore it is known as Vedanta. So the knowledge that reveals the true nature of the self is none other than Ishvara. In other words, only the self can know itself, a statement found in the Jnyaaneshwari\u2019s opening statement \u201cjaya jaya sva samvedyaa\u201d \u2013 salutations to that which knows itself.        With this shloka, Shri Krishna concludes the topic of Ishvara\u2019s manifestations which began in the twelfth shloka. The change in metre reinforces the conclusion. We learned that ultimately, it is Ishvara that provides awareness, nourishment, food, and the power to absorb food as well as knowledge to all beings on this. Not only does he produce all of this, he consumes it as well. If we truly let this statement sink in, we will realize that our false \u201cI\u201d, our ego, is nowhere to be found."

The energy stored in this food has to be absorbed and assimilated into all living beings. How does that happen? Shri Krishna says that Ishvara manifests himself as Vaishvaanara, the fire inside all living beings which represents the process of metabolism.        It is a wonder that we are able to eat such a large variety of food, and yet derive enough energy to keep our bodies running throughout our lives, all due to the functioning of the Vaishvaanara fire. It is supported by two vayus or forces known as the Praana and the Apaana vayus. The Praana vayu brings food towards the digestive organs. Vaishvaanara is the process of digestion and metabolism. The Apaana vayu pushes non-essential portions of the food out into the world.        We also come across the four types of food that are referenced in scriptures. These are : food that can be chewed such as rice, food that can be sucked such as mango nectar, food that can be drunk such as fruit juices, and food that can be licked such as pickles. The Vaishvaanara fire can convert all these types of food into energy for the body.        So we see that production, distribution and ultimate consumption of energy that happens in us, and happens in any other living being, is nothing but Ishvara. Ishvara is the producer, distributor and consumer. Remembering this topic is a great way to reduce our ego and see our oneness with the world. Many people in India, in fact, chant the 15th chapter before their meals in order to pray for good digestion."

Despite several advances in the field, they are yet to find the grand theory that unifies the different understandings of gravity, electromagnetism, atomic forces and so on. Shri Krishna says that it is Ishvara that enters the earth and sustains every being, every atom in it through his force. Just like there is a force holding our body together, there is a force that holds the earth as one entity. So whenever we admire the granduer and majesty of earth\u2019s natural wonders, we should not forget that the very same force holds our body together as one cohesive unit.        Energy requires a medium to travel from its source to its destination. In order to provide nourishment to all living beings, Ishvara resides in the form of nectar, the sap, the essence of all vegetation. A healthy plant-life in any ecosystem ensures the prosperity of animals, birds and humans that depend upon it. Many commentators including Shri Shankaraacharya have translated Soma to mean the moon. It is said that the moon\u2019s light enhances the nutrional value of all plant life. This sap, this essence within the plants that gives energy to all life also gives us energy. Moreover, many herbs have medicinal value in additional to their nutritional value, providing yet another layer of benefits to all animals and humans.        In this manner, whether it is energy, nourishment or healing, Ishvara is pulsating through us in the very same manner that he is pulsating through the world. Now, this energy needs to be extracted from its source and absorbed into our bodies. We shall see how Ishvara makes this happen in the next shloka."

But if that is all we focus on, we will have incomplete knowledge about our true nature. When we look around us, we see the world in all its beautiful yet complex glory. We need to investigate into the true nature of the world, and realize our identity and connection with that as well. With this view in mind, Shri Krishna now begins to explain his connection with the world around us.        He starts this topic by asserting that the splendour of the sun, the moon, and of fire is possible only because of Ishvara\u2019s splendour. We have tremendous awe for the sun\u2019s energy, without which life on this earth will not be possible. Shri Krishna says that the sun\u2019s splendour is not its own. It comes from the splendour of Ishvara. Symbolically, the sun represents the organs of perception such as the eyes, ears, nose and so on. Therefore, whenever any sentient being in this world, from a single celled amoeba to a human being becomes aware of something, that awareness, that consciousness, is the power of Ishvara at work.          So whenever we see awareness manifest itself in any organism, we should remind ourselves that the one Ishvara giving awareness to us is the same Ishvara giving awareness to the organisms in the world. In this manner, we can realize the identity of our nature with the world through the common link of awareness.        Furthermore, both the moon and fire derive their energy and splendour from the sun. The moon reflects the light of the sun. Fire also is the manifestation of the sun\u2019s energy on a much smaller scale. Therefore, energy in any form, whether it is dazzling like the sun, cooling like the moon, or warm like fire, is nothing but Ishvara\u2019s energy. How does this energy manifest itself in the world? Shri Krishna explains that in the next shloka."

There are a small number of people who are putting in great effort or dedication, but not obtaining the desired outcome. A select few, however, are able to channelize their efforts in the right direction and get what they want.        Shri Krishna called the vast majority of people, the first category, stuck in the cycle of Prakriti \u201cdeluded\u201d in the last shloka. Here, he says that it is the preparation of mind that determines whether or not the efforts taken by yogis \u2013 those who are striving for liberation \u2013 have a chance of success. One without a prepared mind is termed as \u201cakritaatmaanaha\u201d in this shloka. So then, those of us who are aiming for liberation would not like our striving to be in vain. What should we do?        We need to understand what Shri Krishna means by purifying our mind. There are two aspects to this. The first aspect is the degree of selfish desires. Unless we have followed the path of karma yoga and bhakti yoga as laid out in the earlier portions of the Gita, our mind will not be able to properly absorb any scriptural teaching whatsoever. The second aspect is the type of knowledge we are trying to absorb and the method of doing so. A systematic understanding of the scriptures under the guidance of a teacher is the only way. One who does not follow a systematic process of imbibing knowledge is termed \u201cachetasaha\u201d, devoid of wisdom.        The topic of the jeeva is concluded in this shloka. with the message that only those with a pure mind and systematic study will truly understand the nature of the jeeva as the eternal essence as though limited by its upaadhis or conditionings."

We saw how a false \u201cI\u201d called the ego is created, by usurping the awareness or sentiency of the eternal essence. All this is possible through the illusory identification of the jeeva with the ego. Shri Krishna now wants to summarize and conclude the topic of the fall of the jeeva by distinguishing between those individuals who recognize, who know the lifecycle jeeva versus those who do not. He says that only those with the eye of wisdom can truly understand the notion of the jeeva as separate and distinct from the physical body, as well as the reason for its existence. Others cannot.        Most of us tend to think that the brain is sentient and self-aware, when it is inert and borrows awareness from the jeeva. Most of us think that what we our senses tell us is real, when it is actually nothing but the play of the three gunaas. Most of us derive enjoyment from the world, when our real nature is that of joy. Most of us think that the \u201cI\u201d is our ego, our ahankaara when it is actually the eternal essence. These incorrect beliefs are collectively termed as ajnyaana or ignorance.         The jnyaana chakshu, the eye of wisdom, refers to those people who have removed all of these incorrect notions. They do not hesitate to challenge any thought, idea, concept or emotion since all of this is in the plane of the three gunaas. On the other hand, most of us will not challenge the long held beliefs about the world that we are programmed with. Since we do not lost our fascination for the world even after being told several times by our scriptures, Shri Krishna addressed us as \u201cvimoodha\u201d, completely deluded. How then, do those select few people gain the eye of wisdom? We will see in the next shloka."

We can use the wonderful Vedantic text \u201cDrig Drishya Viveka\u201d, or \u201cDiscrimination of the seer and the seen\u201d, to examine this process in a little more detail. It explains, with almost mathematical precision, how the eternal essence begins to think of itself as a finite human entity. There are two main players in this process. One is the eternal essence, which is of the nature of infinite awareness and existence, explained in great detail in the second chapter. Let us call it \u201cOm\u201d here. The second player is avidya or ignorance, which exists in the realm of the illusory Maaya.         When Om and ignorance come into contact with each other, a fragment of Om is reflected in ignorance, just like a fragment of the sun as though appears in the water of a pot. As we saw earlier, this fragment is called the jeeva. Ignorance creates an apparent limitation, also known an upaadhi, which imposes a sense of incompleteness or finitude upon the jeeva. The jeeva seeks the help of the upaadhi to remove its sense of completeness. The upaadhi can exist in one of many modifications or states. Let us examine these modifications. The sense organs are modifications of this upaadhi that can contact different aspects of Prakriti. The mind is a modification of this upaadhi that can take input from the sense organs, compare that input with its memory, and present a complete picture of what was contacted.  The ego is another modification that thinks of itself as the \u201cI\u201d, just like a low level manager thinks of himself as the owner of the factory in the absence of the real owner.        Now let us examine the content of this shloka. After the end of its journey in one body, the jeeva travels with the mind and senses, the upaadhi in other words, in search of another physical body. When the ego aspect of the upaadhi associates itself with a tiny physical body inside a womb, based on the desires its wants to exhaust, it develops the notion \u201cI am this body\u201d. It now begins to use the body to transact with the world. The human nose, for instance, is an inert object. But due to the association of the ego with the body, we think that the physical human nose is doing the smelling. The ego then uses the mind to generate the notion \u201cI know that this smell is that of a rose\u201d. This finally leads the ego to generate the notion \u201cThis smell it pleasant, it makes me happy\u201d.        In this way, the jeeva gives up its power of reality, knowledge and happiness to the ego. The ego becomes the doer and the experiencer of the world. It has to constantly transact with the world in order to chase sense objects for happiness. It forgets the fact that it was happy to begin with. It gives reality to the domain of Prakriti, the three gunas, the visible and so called tangible world. But we should not forget that behind all this is the illusory mix up of Om and ignorance, the mix up of awareness and inertness. The Raamacharitamanas describes this mix up as \u201cjada chetan ki granthi\u201d or the knot between awareness and inertness."

In preparation to do so, it surrounds itself with the mind (which contains the desires) and the five senses. This collection of the jeeva, the mind and the senses is also known as the subtle body, because it is invisible. We can think of the subtle body as a computer file. Just as a computer file needs a computer to express itself, a subtle body needs a physical body to express itself. Whenever the timespan of one human body ends, the subtle body has to find another physical body to continue exhausting its desires.         Shri Krishna says that in such a situation, the subtle body, the jeeva with the mind and senses, ejects itself from the physical body and finds another body to settle in. It is similar to a international diplomat who goes from one assignment to another, taking his staff with him wherever he goes. Since the mind and senses follow the jeeva, it is referred to as Ishvara or the lord here, not to be confused with the meaning of Ishvara that has been used throughout the Gita. Once the jeeva finds a new home, it slowly starts unpacking its belongings, the mind and senses, in sequence. It is fascinating to see time-lapse videos of an embryo growing inside a mother\u2019s womb. This is the jeeva slowly gaining its faculties, which are nothing but accumulations of additional upaadhis.        Imagine that a small wooden box contains a strong perfume. If the box \u2013 the seat of the perfume \u2013 is opened, the fragrance will slowly start leaving the box and fill the room. Shri Krishna uses this analogy to explain the transfer of the jeeva from one physical body to another. If we bring in the analogy of the eternal essence as space, and combine it with this analogy, we will find that they fit together perfectly. Walls, fragrance, wind, boxes \u2013 all these limitations of space are apparent, not real. They are upaadhis, apparent limitations. Space does not care whether we build 2 walls or 2 million walls. No one or nothing can limit space. There is no coming and going of the perfume in space. It is only from a worldly standpoint that the fragrance is moving from the box to the room."

Now Shri Krishna summarizes the state of the jeevas, the individual souls who are stuck in the cycle of samsaara, of birth and death. The jeeva, ignorant of its true nature which is infinite, harbours selfish desires with the aim of removing its finitude. In order to do so, it needs to be able to contact and transact with Prakriti. The equipment needed to transact with Prakriti comprises the mind and the five senses. Therefore, the jeeva attracts or pulls these six aspects of Prakriti unto itself.        Before we proceed, we need to clarify one point here. The word fragment implies that the eternal essence, speaking as Ishvara, can be broken or divided into pieces. Yet, we know that the eternal essence is indivisible. To solve this confusion, we need to remind ourselves of the examples provided in the thirteenth chapter. We can try to divide space using walls, but space is indivisible. Also, we can lose the sun\u2019s reflection when we break a pot filled with water, but nothing happens to the sun. There is no coming or going of space or of the sun. The limitations, the upaadhis such as walls and pots \u201cas though\u201d try to divide, but cannot do so in essence.        The Jnyaaneshwari provides yet another example. It describes an ascetic monk who has taken up a contemplative and solitary life in the jungle. One night he dreams that he is a householder with a wife and kids. In order to provide for his family, he has to work hard at his job to make ends meet. His job causes a great deal of stress to him. But when he wakes up from his dream, he remains the same monk, unaffected by the apparent ties of family life. The dream world is yet another upaadhi or limitation caused by ignorance of his real nature.        So then, the jeeva draws a mind and five senses in order to exhaust its desires. However, it still needs a physical body to transact with Prakriti. How does all this happen? We see this in the next shloka."

He now provides the location, the address of that abode. He says that there is no sun, no moon, no fire, in other words, no source of light in his abode. Initially we would feel a little frightened if we take the literal meaning of this shloka. Even cavemen were able to access some light source in the form of the sun, the moon, or fire from a wooden torch. Why would anyone want to go to such a place?        The sun, the moon and fire have symbolic interpretations which are extremely relevant here. The sun is the presiding deity of our intellect, the moon of our mind and emotions, and fire of our physiological functions. The one who has sought refuge in Ishvara automatically gives up affinity to his body, mind, intellect, ego (which resides in the intellect) and physiological functions. If this affinity, the root of all our sorrow, is given up, such a person will never again get caught in the wheel of birth of death, in the cycle of samsaara. This is liberation.        So then, this is the abode of Ishvara, of self realization, of liberation. Having reached there, the liberated person does not come back to the state of ignorance. He never gets deluded again. He never identifies or develops affinity with body, mind, intellect and the world. The duality, the pairs of opposites, the dvandva that was mentioned before, is nothing but the world. For such a person, neither joy nor sorrow, neither pain nor pleasure, neither friend nor enemy, nothing can destabilize him. This is liberation."

This complex and elaborate topic has been very nicely packed into one shloka by Shri Krishna. The first qualification of a seeker is the absence, or at least, reduction of the sense of I and mine. Candidates who are interviewing for a new position frequently pass off an entire team\u2019s effort as their own. It is very easy to spot the inflated sense of pride in them. And even if they spent a few minutes contributing to a project, they still have the notion that it is their project, nobody else\u2019s. Shri Krishna says that this I and mine notion, this pride and delusion has to go away in a seeker.        Once the I and mine notion has diminished to some extent, the seeker has to focus on where is he stuck, where is his attachment in this world. Some may be attached to their profession, some may be attached to their family, some may be perversely attached to their enemies also. But, if we slowly unwind the attachments towards their source, we will find that the seeker is attached to his body. The attachment to the body, and the consequent fear of death, is the toughest attachment for the seeker to tackle. A certain level of dispassion towards the body, accomplished through control of the mind and senses, is a prerequisite to worship of Ishvara. When this happens, desires that are a by product of attachment, also diminish.        So, two qualifications are covered so far: absence of I and mine notion, and conquering one\u2019s attachments. Only then will we be able to focus on the main goal, which is daily absorption in the self, adhyaatma nitya. But how do we remain in this state constantly? By being vigilant of labelling the two pairs of opposites \u2013 likes and dislikes, joy and sorrow, praise and censure and so on and so forth. Even a whiff of wind on either side of a tightrope walker is sufficient to bring him down. Likes and dislikes have the ability to distract us from our goal. We should not pay too much attention to them, just observe them silently as they come and go. This is forbearance or titkshaa. This will enable us to completely remove ignorance of the true nature of our self, and to reach the abode of Ishvara, described in the next shloka."

The husband says no, and continues driving in circles for an hour. The wife yells at the husband who finally agrees to ask a shopkeeper for directions. This is an all too common occurrence. Unless the ego is surrendered, even material knowledge is far from reach.        Shri Krishna says : All of you are thoroughly lost in the cycle of action and reaction, the tree of samsaara. So take refuge in me. I am the original Purusha, the root from which this tree of samsaara has sprung up. I have created this universe like a magician creates his illusion. Don\u2019t get lost in the branches of the tree which are fueled by the three gunas of Prakriti. Come straight to the source, which is me. I am giving you a hand to save you from drowning in samsaara. Hold it tightly and do not let it go. This is the meaning of the word prapatti, which had also come up in the seventh chapter.        This prapatti, this seeking of refuge in Ishvara will help us cultivate dispassion towards samsaara. But this dispassion will not come overnight, it will come gradually. First, karma yoga has to be practised as prescribed by Shri Krishna. We should reduce selfish actions, increase selfless actions, then drop our attitude of doership. We cannot have it both ways \u2013 we cannot love Ishvara and love the material world at the same time. If we cannot control our mind and senses, we have yet to cultivate real devotion for Ishvara. Devotion, coupled with dispassion towards the world, will result in our liberation, the goal from which we will not have to return back to the material world."

We simply live out our lives in the endless chain of attraction to sense objects, desire, action, result and further desire. To lift us out of this narrow view of life, he very compassionately gives us the illustration of the tree of samsaara in the previous two shlokas.         He very clearly states that no matter who we are, whether rich or poor, educated or uneducated, fit or sick, we are all entangled in this upside down tree of samsaara.

Here, he continues to describe it in more detail. When its buds or sprouts grown into branches and touch the ground, they turn into roots that embed firmly into the ground, and then grow into several additional trunks around the main tree. Such gigantic tree structures are common in the Banyan tree family. Over a period of time, a small tree with one trunk becomes a mini forest in itself.        Our lives are no different. For many people, the American dream comprises owning a large house, two cars, good schools for children, a big screen TV and so on. First, the newly married family takes out a big loan to buy a house. The house is empty, so it needs furniture and appliances. The garage is empty, so two cars need to be purchased. The living room is empty, so a large screen TV is needed. The TV requires a cable connection, a DVD player, a Playstation and so on endlessly. The one purchase of a house led to other purchases, which led to other purchases and so on. This is nothing but the upside down tree of samsaara playing out in our lives.        So this tree of samsaara, made up of the three gunas of Prakriti, grows and expands through repetitive chasing of sense objects. Each sense object generates desires, desires generate actions to get those sense objects, and attainment of sense objects creates further desires. Actions bind us by making us giving importance to the branches of the tree, by making us run away from Ishvara, who is at the root of the tree. How do we tackle this problem? Shri Krishna gives the solution in the next shloka.        Notes1. Computer scientists will recognize the tree of samsaara as a recursive process."

It is \u201coordhvamoolam adhahashaakham\u201d. It is upside down, with roots above and branches below. It is not as unusual as it sounds, because we encounter several trees that are inverted in our lives. A family tree, the map of an organization with the CEO on top, a decision tree in management sciences, all of these trees are upside down, with their root on top and branches below.        Such inverted trees have some interesting characteristics. The farther away one goes from the root, the greater is the loss of the substance or the essence. A junior employee has far less power than the CEO in an org chart, for instance. Also, these trees are never static. They keep changing. Hence, the tree described in this illustration is called \u201cashvattha\u201d, which means not lasting for long. This is also the name of the tree known as ficus religiosa, or the Peepul tree in India.        Now, let us examine the metaphors used in this illustration. The root of this tree is Ishvara, the saguna brahman, the eternal essence with form. Its branches have evolved from Ishvara, and are nothing but the hardening of Prakriti, the hardening of the three gunas due to their permutations and combinations. The process of the creation of the universe has been explained in detail in prior chapters. It is similar to a tender, subtle sapling hardening into a robust tree as it grows over time. It is termed as avyayam or imperishable because it is permanent after its reality has been ascertained, like the illusion of the blue sky. Even when we come to know that the sky is not really blue, but just looks that way, we still perceive the illusion.        In any complex system, there are rules that tell how what to do and what not to do. The Vedas are the rules of this universe, and are metaphorically represented as the leaves of this ashvattha tree. Just like there are rules on how to get promoted in a corporation, there are rules in the Vedas that give us instructions on how to act in life, and how not to commit sins or errors. They are the storehouse of knowledge and actions needed to thrive in this world. One who knows the functioning of the universe in this manner, one who knows how to get to the source which is Ishvara, needs to know nothing else.        We now come to the fundamental question. Why has Shri Krishna started talking about this tree now? It is to cultivate dispassion or vairagya in us. Even a tinge of attachment to the world can derail our spiritual progress. Over the next few shlokas, we will learn more about this tree so that we can understand our entanglement in it, and consequently, learn how to release ourselves from it through dispassion."

        "content": "In the thirteenth chapter, we leaned that our existence in this world is the result of a two-step problem. First, ignorance of our real nature creates this illusory but distinct entity called the Purusha or the jeeva. The jeeva gets trapped as a result of its attachment to the three gunas of Prakriti. In order to provide the means by which we can detach ourselves from the three gunas, Shri Krishna reveals this teaching in the fourteenth chapter.        He begins by glorifying this knowledge, and by revealing its fruit as fruit as liberation or moksha. He reiterates that the combination of the awareness aspect and the material aspect of Ishvara gives rise to this entire universe. The jeeva, the awareness aspect of Ishvara present in each of us, identifies with Prakriti, the material aspect. This identification, a product of ignorance, ensnares us in the endless cycle of birth and death in various kinds of wombs.        Next, we are led through a detailed analysis of Prakriti. Like the driver who erroneously identifies with someone else\u2019s car and bears the consequences of that identification, we identify with the three gunas erroneously and are bound by their characteristics. Sattva binds through attachment to joy and knowledge. Rajas binds through attachment to action. Tamas binds through attachment to heedlessness, laziness and sloth. Only one guna dominates at one time. When one guna is strong, it overpowers the others.         Shri Krishna gives us the effects of each guna so that we can look within to understand the proportion of gunas within us. If we are full of radiance and knowledge, sattva prevails. If we are greedy all the time, and it results in desire and action, rajas prevails. If we are full of ignorance, heedlessness and error \u2013 tamas prevails.        Our fate after death is also determined by our predominant mental state at the time of death. A sattvic state leads a jeeva to come into a family of knowledge and improve its chance of liberation. A rajasic state leads it into a materialistic and action oriented family. A tamasic state leads a jeeva to take birth as animals or plants, hurting its chances of liberation. But to achieve liberation, we need to transcend all the three gunas.         Arjuna asks the question \u2013 what are signs of one who has transcended the three gunas? Shri Krishna replies \u2013 it is one who is not impacted, affected or attached to any of the gunas. Such a person views the entire universe, including his body, as gunas acting upon gunas. How does such a person behave in the world? He shows complete and utter equanimity towards objects, situations and people at all times. And how does one transcend the gunas in practice? Only through single pointed devotion to Ishvara, since Ishvara is the abode of nirguna brahman, the unconditioned and pure eternal essence. We need to detach from Prakriti and attach ourselves to Ishvara."

One of the topics in that chapter was the description of nirguna brahman, which is the eternal essence in its purest state. Shri Krishna described the technique of mentally removing the upaadhis \u2013 the veiling of the organs, the senses and so on \u2013 to get to the eternal essence that is at the core all of us. One who attained this eternal essence through jnyaana yoga achieved liberation or moksha. Arjuna recollected this teaching, and a doubt arose in his mind. What was that doubt?          In the previous shloka of this chapter, Shri Krishna asserted that liberation would be attained by the one who has undivided devotion towards Ishvara. But in the previous chapter, Shri Krishna had said that the fruit of knowing the eternal essence in its purest state, nirguna brahman, also resulted in liberation. To address Arjuna\u2019s doubt about the difference between the two approaches, Shri Krishna says here that he, as Ishvara, is the abode of the pure eternal essence, of nirguna brahman. In other words, undivided devotion to Ishvara results in the same outcome as does the yoga of knowledge. He also describes this pure eternal essence as immortal, imperishable, eternal and full of joy, just like he did in the thirteenth chapter. Furthermore, he says that the eternal essence is attained through the dharma or constitution of devotion and knowledge.        Shri Shankaraachaarya provides further nuances to this explanation in his commentary. He says that Prakriti or maaya is a power of nirguna brahman. Just like the strength of a strong person is inseparable from the person itself, maaya is inseparable from nirguna brahman. Therefore, it is nirguna brahman, with the power of maaya, that is speaking to Arjuna as Ishvara. This is the connection between nirguna brahman \u2013 brahman without maaya \u2013 and saguna brahman \u2013 brahman with maaya. Saguna brahman is the abode, and the power, of nirguna brahman. And the methods to attain brahman \u2013 devotion and knowledge \u2013 are two sides of the same coin. With this message, Shri Krishna concludes the fourteenth chapter.        om tatsatiti shreematbhagavatgitasupanishadsu brahmavidyaayaam yogashaastre shreekrishnaarjunsamvade gunatrayavibhaagayogo naama chaturdashodhyaayaha || 14 ||"

We learned that this entire universe, including our mind and body, is nothing but the play of the three gunas of Prakriti \u2013 sattva, rajas and tamas. Only when we learn to stand apart from the gunas, when we separate ourselves from the gunas, can we attain liberation from the endless cycle of sorrow known as samsaara. For most of us, such a high degree of discrimination is extremely difficult. Moreover, such discrimination needs to be combined with dispassion as well as total control of the mind and the sense organs.        Knowing the impediments of fulfilling all these requirements, Arjuna wanted to know whether there was a straightforward way of releasing oneself from the influence of the gunas. Shri Krishna says that yes, it is possible. The answer is the yoga of unwavering devotion, which was the topic of chapters seven to twelve. In a nutshell, we detach ourselves from the gunas by attaching ourselves to something higher, which is Ishvara. It is like the child who gives up his toys because he loves poetry now that he is a teenager.        This yoga of devotion is not completely without effort, however. Shri Krishna adds an adjective that we need to bear in mind \u2013 avyabhichaarena or unwavering. We cannot keep Ishvara as our goal from 7 am to 8 am and then start thinking about how to demolish our competitors from 8 am to 11 am. The one and only goal should be Ishvara. If all our goals are within the scope of our svadharma, our prescribed role in this world, they very naturally are part and parcel of our devotion towards Ishvara.        Having made Ishvara our only goal, and having maintained such an awareness throughout our life, we become fit to attain brahman. How does that happen? The next and last shloka of this chapter addresses this topic."

Suddenly, in the middle of the play, the actor playing King Lear starts speaking his own dialogue instead of following the script. After a few minutes of commotion, the curtain is lowered. Later, when asked as to why he spoke his own lines, the actor asserted that he thought his own lines were better than Shakespeare\u2019s. It will be quite difficult for such an actor to get any more roles, or keep his existing roles, if he were to force his own views onto the script.        Shri Krishna says that the one who has truly renounced all activities, given all up notions such as \u201cI am doing this, I am doing that\u201d, such a person can be called the one who has gone beyond the three gunas. Like actors in a play, all activities in the world are nothing but the gunas interacting with the gunas. If we harbour the notion that our \u201cI\u201d is somehow involved in these activities, we have identified ourselves with our body, which is nothing but a product of the gunas. Through discrimination and detachment, we can see ourselves as distinct and separate from the gunas.        Such a person who can maintain this detachment from the gunas is indifferent to what the world thinks of him. Honour and dishonour are the same to him. If a friend helps him, he does not get elated. If a foe troubles him, he sees it as an opportunity to further increase his vairagya or dispassion towards the world. Any time the thought that \u201cI did this\u201d or \u201cI earned this\u201d enters his mind, he immediately discards it and brings back the awareness that everything is happening in Prakriti, the three gunas.        So, with this shloka and the previous one, Shri Krishna answers the question, what is the conduct of one who has transcended the gunas."

He says that such a person maintains a state of balance, a state of equanimity in his dealing with objects of the world and with people. Right from the second chapter, Shri Krishna has repeatedly emphasized the importance of maintaining samatva or equanimity in our lives, and does so again in this shloka. Only he who has transcended the gunas can maintain this level of equanimity. Such a person is termed \u201cdhira\u201d or wise, and \u201csvastha\u201d meaning self-established or healthy by Shri Krishna.        Three types of objects are mentioned in this shloka : a lump of clay, a stone, and a piece of gold. The person who has transcended the gunas will understand the real-world, practical difference in value of all these three objects. He will also know that at some times, some of these objects will bring joy, and some of these objects will bring sorrow. When he has to rush to the hospital to deal with a medical emergency, no piece of gold can bring him joy. He will continually maintain the awareness that clay, stone and gold, and the subsequent joy and sorrow that they bring, are nothing but the gunas playing with themselves. With this knowledge, he will maintain his balance and equanimity.        Now we look at how such a person deals with people. When people praise us or act in our interest, they become dear to us. When they insult us or trouble us in any way, we begin to detest them. Just like objects, different types of people can generate different reactions in different circumstances. Friends can become rivals, relatives can become enemies, even families can fall apart within minutes. One who has learned to transcend the gunas will transact with people appropriate to the situation, but will never hold on to one person, or run away from them. Praise, insult, friend, foe, all these are interactions between gunas. His \u201cI\u201d, his self, has nothing to do with any of these."

He now addresses the second question \u2013 how does one who has gone beyond the gunas behave in this world. He says that such a person lives life with ease and grace. He is like the graceful elephant who walks on the road, unaffected by the horde of dogs that is barking at him. We have come across such people ourselves, who remain calm and unperturbed even when facing their darkest personal challenges.        What makes a person so calm? There are two factors. First, even though such a person may not look like a monk from the outside, he has a great deal of detachment towards the world. Second, such a person is seated on an unshakeable platform, his own self. Both factors are possible through the conviction and constant awareness that the entire world, including one\u2019s own body, is a play of the three gunas. It is the difference between getting swept away by the waves or sitting calmly on the beach. It is the difference between participating in a street fight or observing the fight from a second floor balcony.        What does all this mean in practice? It means when our mind is agitated, we will not crave for a peaceful state. We will accept that a certain level of agitation, a certain level of rajas is part and parcel of daily life. We will simply watch that mental state arise, persist, and go away, only to be replaced by another state. We will view the whole world as the gunas interacting with the gunas. The \u201cI\u201d within us will be firmly seated in itself, with a healthy level of distance and detachment from the movement of those gunas. It will stop identifying, giving importance, giving reality to the play of gunas. The gunas will move, but the \u201cI\u201d within us will not."

Light, activity and delusion refer to sattva, rajas and tamas respectively. One who is indifferent to the rise and fall of each guna, one who has a high degree of detachment and discrimination, one who lets the gunas come and go with ease, such a person has transcended the gunas. It is the difference between one who observes suitcases on an airport conveyor belt versus one who holds on to a suitcase and doesn\u2019t let go. The one who insists on holding on gets pulled away.        When we are on vacation, our mind feels peaceful and relaxed. But when we come back from vacation, our mind becomes agitated since it has to get back to the nine to five routine of life. We want to hold on to that state of mind we had experienced when we were on vacation. In other words, we have an insistence, also known as aagraha, to hold on to a sattvic state when rajas comes in. Or when the alarm bell rings in the morning, we want to hold on to that sleepy tamasic state as long as possible, and not leave the bed. This aagraha, this insistence on holding on to one guna and not accepting the arrival of another guna, enables the gunas to control us. One who has transcended the gunas has given up this insistence through extreme vairagya or detachment.        Let\u2019s look at it in another way. When we read comics, we can see what the characters are thinking through thought bubbles. For example, if Veronica insulted Archie, Archie would have a thought bubble that says \u201cI feel so bad\u201d. We temporarily feel sorry for Archie, and move on to the next frame in the comic. But if someone insults us in real life, we don\u2019t usually move on that quickly. We hold on to that thought, as well as the tamasic or rajasic state of mind created by that thought, for weeks, months, or years to come. And that is not all. We bring up that mental state each time we meet the person who insulted us.         When we are able to treat our thoughts with the same detachment that we do when we are reading other people\u2019s thoughts in comic books, we will know that we have gone beyond the gunas."

Arjuna also asked the signs of a perfected devotee in the chapter on bhakti yoga. Every time he has asked a question, we as listeners have benefitted tremendously.        Having heard a detailed explanation around the three gunas, but only a couple of shlokas on the person who transcends those gunas and attains immortality, Arjuna found it appropriate to ask a question at this juncture. He wanted to know three things. First, how does one know that a person has transcended the three gunas. Second, how does such a person behave in the world. Third, how does he actually transcend the three gunas.        We have to constantly remind ourselves that everything we learn from this chapter is purely for self-analysis, not for judging or evaluating someone else. The only person that can accurately determine whether our mental state is sattvic, rajasic or tamasic is none other than ourselves. There is another aspect to learning about the signs of one who has gone beyond the influence of the gunas. Until we reach the state of liberation, these signs are attributes that we should aspire to cultivate in our lives."

He says that Prakriti, which is comprised of the three gunaas, creates this entire universe, including our body. As long as the individual soul, the jeeva, the body dweller identifies with this body and gives reality to it, he experiences sorrows throughout his life. Once the jeeva stops identifying with the body which is the product of the three gunaas, he attains liberation and becomes immortal.        This shloka also connects the main theme of the prior chapter to this chapter. In the thirteenth chapter, we learnt that ignorance of our true nature creates an entity called the Purusha, which in essence is nothing but a bundle of unfulfilled desires. Now here, we learn that these unfulfilled desires, also known as avidyaa, ignorance or maaya, attract a combination of sattva, rajas and tamas that becomes the physical body. Only when the Purusha severs his connection with this body by rising above the three gunaas, he realizes his true nature as the eternal essence.        Immortality in this context does not mean physical immortality. The body follows the laws of nature. Everything in nature has to perish, including our physical body. From the perspective of Prakriti, the body will die. But the dehi, the body dweller, having gone beyond the three gunas, having stopped identifying with the three gunas, knows that he is untouched and unaffected by the laws of Prakriti. For him, the modifications of the body such as old age and disease are as if they are happening to some third party. This ultimate freedom from the influence of the Prakriti is what makes him immortal."

When he comes home, he watches the channel as a detached observer. But the child, due to his addiction, gets affected by the blows received by the boxer in the boxing match.        The CEO keeps reminding his son to not get so attached to the boxing match since it is not real, it is just a television program. Once the child has identified himself as the boxer, he will have to accept all the consequences of that character in that particular TV show. In the same way, Shri Krishna urges us to not get trapped in the machine called Prakriti. If we identify with Prakriti, which is nothing but the three gunas, then we have to accept all its laws including birth, death, rebirth, joy, sorrow and so on. We have to understand that we neither do anything, nor do we experience the result of our actions. All action and reaction is within the realm of Prakriti. Once we establish ourselves as a witness, we understand that we have incorrectly taken on action and reaction upon ourselves.        Knowing this reality, however, does not mean that Prakriti will go away. Even if the child has stopped identifying with the boxer, the boxing match will be broadcast every day at 8 PM. Similarly, even if we are not bound by it, Prakriti will be tangible and visible to us during our waking hours. The entire universe, including the body that we are  identified with, is made up of the three gunas of Prakriti. But despite it appearing to us as an apparent reality, Prakriti will be unable to bind us with its laws once we recognize it as an illusion, and not as reality. Once we are able to rise beyond identification with the three gunas, we will see Prakriti the way Ishvara sees Prakriti, as a detached observer. In this manner, when we realize our identity with Ishvara, we will attain the state of liberation, of self realization."

If parents notice that their child is lazy and remains idle all the time, they will first motivate him through selfish desires. They will teach him that if he studies hard and works hard, he will be able to buy fast cars, electronic gadgets, a big house and so on. Once he has risen from a tamasic state to a rajasic state, and has made enough money, his parents will encourage him to slowly start transitioning from rajasic action to selfless, sattvic actions like donating money to charity, volunteering and so on.        Shri Krishna gives us a similar roadmap for our evolution in this shloka. He says that once we have determined our degree of rajas and tamas, we should consciously perform the actions necessary to uplift our mental state. If we are primarily tamasic in nature, we should perform rajasic actions. If we are primarily sattvic in nature, we should perform sattvic actions. He also puts the responsibility of self improvement squarely on our shoulders. No other person can make this happen. The will to self improve must come from within.        Let us imagine for a moment that we are able to uplift ourselves to the level of sattva, where we are able to remain in a sattvic state for a majority of the day, as a consequence of performing sattvic, selfless actions. Is this our goal, or is this yet another milestone in our spiritual journey? The thirteenth chapter taught us that we have become the individual soul, the jeeva, the Purusha, by forgetting our true nature as the eternal essence. We have further become entangled in Prakriti by identifying with a mind and body that are under the influence of the gunas. Once we are able to stay in sattva, and minimize the effects of rajas and tamas, how do we then disentangle ourselves from Prakriti? Shri Krishna picks up this topic next."

Their persistence in getting over the initial pain of going to the gym has paid off. They enjoy the state being healthy and being fit. Intelligent action has shaped their physical state, and consequently, the physical state gives its result.          Similarly, mental states that were shaped by intelligent actions give results as well. Shri Krishna says that sattvic mental state gives us access to material and spiritual knowledge, since our intellect improves its ability to think clearly and grasp information quickly. A rajasic mental state makes us act in the world to rush after objects. We want objects we do not have, and want more of objects that we already have. A tamasic mental state has the worst possible outcome. It keeps us steeped in ignorance of the material world, and of our true nature. We do not want to act at all, and even if we do, we perform furtile actions, or perform careless actions.        This shloka and the prior shloka point out the self reinforcing nature of actions and gunaas. If we consciously perform sattvic actions day after day, we will generate a greater proportion of sattva in our mind, which will further spur sattvic actions. This is the logic behind karma yoga. By urging us to perform selfless actions, Shri Krishna wants us to rise from our rajasic and tamasic existence to one of greater sattva."

Even if they go to the gym for ten minutes every day, they will lose weight. This is because habits are self reinforcing. A behaviour creates a habit, which pushes us to repeat the behaviour, which strengthens the habit, and so on.        Similarly, we can shape our mental states by choosing our actions consciously. Shri Krishna says that sattvic or selfless actions generate a sattvic state, rajasic or selfish actions generate a rajasic state, and tamasic or ignorant actions generate a tamasic state. If we are predominantly rajasic by nature, we can improve our state by emphasizing the performance of sattvic actions. If we are predominantly tamasic by nature, we can change it by emphasizing the performance of rajasic actions.           The law of karma holds true in every situation, including this one. If we perform rajasic actions, we will attain temporary joy, which will eventually generate sorrow. It does not take a large amount of raaga dvesha, likes or dislikes, to make us act selfishly. And if we perform tamasic actions,  we will continue to live our lives in inertness and ignorance. Only through sattvic actions will we create a state of purity and serenity in our mind."

Here, he says that one whose mental state is rajasic while dying is reborn in a family of action oriented individuals. Also, one whose mental state is tamasic while dying is reborn in the wombs of the ignorant and the inert. This includes plants, trees, creepers, birds, insects and other animals.          It is not just the mental state that determines one\u2019s fate in the next life. Every action we perform leaves impressions in our mind, which also impacts our fate. One who has performed selfless actions throughout their life is born in a virtuous family. One who has performed selfish actions is born with a tendency to get attached to material objects. And one who has performed harmful actions is born with devilish tendencies. Such a person will not stop at anything to get their way, including physically harming others. In their current life and in their next life, it is totally up to each individual to cultivate their discrimination through selfless service, devotion and company of devotees so that they can counteract the effect of excessive rajas.        The Srimad Bhagavatam tells the story of the illustrious king Bharata who was one of the most sattvic individuals of his time. Through extreme attachment to his pet deer, he became steeped in tamas, and was born as a deer in his next life. But due to the selfless actions performed in his life as a king, he developed a degree of renunciation not even found in humans. He was finally born as a highly sattvic human who ultimately achieved liberation. Shri Krishna repeatedly urges us to employ rajas to perform selfless service, and cultivate sattva through reducing selfish activities."

He says that one whose mind is in a sattvic state during the time of death travels to realms that are subtler than the human world. These realms are termed as \u201cBrahmaloka\u201d, the abode of Lord Brahma. It is said that there is no room for any desire, sorrow or disease in such realms, given the complete absence of rajas or tamas. Such people, however, are still subject to the bondages caused by sattva, as discussed previously.        Let us revisit the example of the young child who has developed a strong identification with a television character played by the actor \u201cABC\u201d. ABC\u2019s run as an action hero in a popular TV show has ended. He has decided to play the role of a serious professor in his new TV series. The young child now has a choice. He can either continue to identify with ABC in his new role as a professor, or find another TV show with an action hero to identify with. The choice depends on the young child\u2019s mental state. If it is heavily rajasic, he will find another action hero. If it has some sattva, he will follow ABC as a professor.          Similarly, our desires and thoughts, which are driven by the gunaas that influence us, will determine our fate after this physical body drops. The subtle body, which is nothing but our desires and thoughts, will attract another physical body that enables it to carry out those desires. It is almost similar to DNA shaping a body based on the programming it contains. Therefore, if our subtle body harbours sattvic thoughts, it will gain entry into a highly sattvic body after death. But if it continues to harbour rajasic or tamasic thoughts, it will obtain a different destination. This is explained in the next shloka."

He was probably hinting that some members of the Kuru dynasty, the Kauravas, were under the influence of tamas. When we are under the influence of tamas, we make erroneous decisions. We become inert like a stone, resorting to inaction. Even when we act, it is out of heedlessness. Our knowledge is covered by tamas, creating darkness within us.        Let us go deeper into what inaction really means. When we have a lack of drive to achieve anything in the world, when we wants to escape all sense of responsibilities, when all ambitions go away, that is inaction. Moha, error or delusion is even worse. We cannot accurately judge our relationship with the world, with other people, with our family, our friends, our job and so on. We become a \u201cgood for nothing\u201d, and will remain in that state unless someone wakes us up.        Nature has its own scale of tamas, rajas and sattva. It is better to crawl like an insect than lie around like a stone, better to work like an ant rather than crawl like an ant, better to pollinate flowers like a bird than simply work like an ant, better to give milk to others like a cow than pollinate flowers like a bird, and it is better to work with one\u2019s intellect like a human than to give milk to others like a cow. So one who is steeped in tamas, should start to act, even if the actions are without any planning or thinking, just to get into a higher mental state."

He says that whenever our mind generates thoughts of greed, selfish activity, commencement of action, unrest or uneasiness, and desire for even trivial things, we should realize that we are under the sway of rajas. In fact, we consider this to be our natural state of mind, especially during the waking hours of the day.        If we look at the first half of the shloka in reverse order, we start with spruha, which is a selfish desire for objects that have nothing to do with our duties, like a gold watch. Frequent thoughts for acquiring the gold watch lead to ashama or restlessness, where we are not satisfied with our present situation and want to do something else. We then begin to act, karmanaam aarambha, so that we can acquire this gold watch. Our plans may lead us to do another part time job or withdraw from our savings, which is pravritti, engaging in selfish action. Even after we acquire the gold watch, we are not satisfied and want another one. That is lobha, greed, the height of rajasic influence on our mind.        It is not easy to detect whether our actions are prompted by selfishness or not. Only a pure mind that has been cleansed of selfishness through karma yoga, with the aid of a guru, can recognize the subtle difference between sattvic and rajasic actions. Karma yoga teaches us to analyze our qualification and proclivity for selecting an appropriate vocation. If we are trained to become an actor, and are also passionately interested in acting, then that becomes our vocation. There is a baseline level of rajas needed to perform actions towards fulfilling the duties of our vocation, which is perfectly fine. Shri Krishna says that we need to watch for signs where rajas increases beyond that baseline level, where selfishness creeps into our actions."

Shri Krishna says that when we see radiance, or when we see knowledge radiating from a person, we should know that we are in the presence of a highly sattvic person. The word \u201cdvaara\u201d usually means door or gate, but here it refers to the sense organs, our doors to the world. Even though the sense organs are meant from receiving stimuli from the world, they can also convey our internal state to the world. Our eyes, especially, can give away our thoughts. If our mind is wandering, our eyes will also wander, for instance. In a sattvic person, radiance shines through the sense organs, especially the eyes.        Now, we should not think that a highly sattvic person will radiate beams of light from their body. But they do radiate calmness and peace. We can sense peace if we are near them, or pick up on their calmness if we are watching them on a screen. Watch Dr. Jane Goodall speak about her efforts to save gorillas in Africa, and you will be drawn to the serenity on her face instantly. Such people harbour few, if any, selfish desires in their mind. This lack of dirt in the form of selfishness lets their inner radiance, the light of their eternal essence, shine through.        From our perspective, whenever we notice an increase in clear thinking, we should know that sattva is predominant in our mind. If we see fried food but the intellect prevents our hand from reaching to pick up that food, we are in a sattvic state. If our thoughts are towards the well-being of the family, our city or our nation, instead of just our narrow well-being, we are in a sattvic state. If our mind is sharp and alert, if we don\u2019t let anything drop in our personal and professional lives, we are in a sattvic state."

Do they work in parallel or do they work in sequence? Is there any one gunaa that is more powerful than the other?        Shri Krishna says that our mind can only be under the impact of one gunaa at a time. This happens when one gunaa assumes dominance, and consequently, asserts its authority over the others. When sattva is dominant, it dominates over rajas and tamas. Similarly, rajas dominates over the other two and tamas over the other two. All three gunaas are at war with each other in our mind. When one gunaa achieves victory, it temporarily defeats the others.        Having known this, we now would like to know which gunaa within us dominates more than others. This is not an easy question to answer, because we have to analyze ourselves and not anyone else. We need to look within. We need to understand what thoughts, feelings and emotions should we watch out for so that we can tie them back to a specific gunaa.

Sattva binds by making us hold on to joy experienced after attaining a sense object. Rajas binds us by giving us joy in performing actions and obtaining their results. Tamas binds us by giving us joy in holding on to laziness and heedlessness. We now begin to look into how these three are interrelated.        In the second chapter, we have come across a series of shlokas that describe how the mind can fall from sattva into rajas and tamas in a matter of seconds. We start with the mind resting in a peaceful sattvic state. A tinge of rajas comes in, causing us to think about some sense object, let\u2019s say a sweet. This fuels rajas further, creating a strong attachment to that sweet, culminating in a strong desire to do anything to get that sweet. But it gets worse. If we cannot get that sweet, if someone or something obstructs our consumption of the sweet, anger arises in us. Rajas deteriorates into tamas. The last rung of the ladder of fall is when anger goes to such an extent that it causes us to lose our faculty of intelligence and memory.        Conversely, we can go from tamas to rajas to sattva, but it may take a little longer. For someone steeped in tamas, immersing themself in action will raise them to the level of rajas. When action becomes focused and directed towards the pursuit of a selfless goal, rajas is elevated to the level of sattva. Swami Vivekananda always used to say \u201cawake, arise, stop not till the goal is reached\u201d. When India was under British rule, many had become accustomed to this slavery and had fallen into a tamasic state. They could not find a way out of their predicament, and were clouded in ignorance. Swami Vivekananda\u2019s message urged citizens to engage in action towards independence. That was the only way to get them out of the tamasic state of laziness."

Our mind starts to operate in moha, which means confusion or error, mistaking one thing for another. Tamas can be triggered by an overpowering emotional situation like Arjuna seeing his family members and loved ones on the opposite side of the battlefield. A tamasic state can also be triggered by abusing our sense organs through excessive drinking, smoking, watching TV and so on.        After a long and tiring day, when we want to rush to get a good night\u2019s sleep, we get a call from a friend who wants to catch up.

Our memory does not work properly and our intellect\u2019s logic is flawed. All we want to do is to rest our head on the pillow. When tamas reaches the height of its potency, we fall asleep.        Shri Krishna says that tamas is born out of ignorance. At its core, tamas keeps the Purusha, the jeeva, body dweller under the delusion that he is the body and not the self. When we forget our true nature as the self, the eternal essence, we assume that our body is who we are. This erroneous notion, this ignorance enables tamas to bind us, to trap us.        Tamas binds us in three ways, through heedlessness, laziness and sloth. Heedlessness is the performance of actions without intellectual focus or awareness. We either perform actions carelessly, such as dialing the wrong phone number, or perform actions that are futile, such as gambling or excessive alcohol consumption. Laziness is postponing or abstaining from our duties. Sloth is lying around in a state of stupor or sleep. Now, there is a place for resting and sleeping in our life, which is at the end of every day. But some of us derive joy from futile actions, from procrastination, from lazing around and so on. It is this joy through which tamas binds us."

Imagine that we have to attend an extremely important meeting at 5 PM. It is 4:50 PM and the taxi is stuck in a traffic jam. Our mind will be in a state of rajas. A series of thoughts will suggest that we wait in the car, while another series of thoughts will suggest that we leave the taxi and start walking. Whenever our mind is agitated by a thoughts that propel us to act, we are in a state of rajas.        Shri Krishna says that rajas creates trishnaa or thirst for what we do not possess, and sanga or attachment towards what we already possess. Furthermore, rajas creates a vicious cycle. It fuels our desires, creates thoughts that compel us to act so that we can acquire objects, then it creates attachment to those objects which further increases rajas. Typically, rajas dominates our mind from sunrise until sunset.        To understand how rajas can bind, consider the case of a multi-millionaire who has recently married his young girlfriend. The millionaire is self sufficient and does not need to work to support himself. But his wife\u2019s brothers, relatives, friends and acquaintances slowly approach him for capital to start their business, connections to get them jobs, advice on their career and so on. Soon, the millionaire ends up working all day, every day. Even though the millionaire does not need to move a finger, he gets bound by his relationship to his wife.           Similarly, even though the self, the \u201cI\u201d does not act, rajas binds the self through attachment to action and its results. It makes us say \u201cI am the doer\u201d and \u201cI am the enjoyer\u201d whereas it is actually Prakriti that is acting and providing the results. Karma yoga helps us come out of this bondage and entrapment. It teaches us to continue to act in this world, but do it in a way that removes our identification with Prakriti. We slowly start submitting the results of our actions to Ishvara, then we slowly start letting Ishvara take over the doership of our actions as well."

We are alert, our mind is able to think very logically, we are able to grasp the most complex statements that we read or hear, and we don\u2019t feel the need to rush out into the world.        Shri Krishna says that sattva refers to purity, brightness and health. Our mind can be compared to the water in a glass cup. When the pond is free from agitation, and all the dirt has settled down, it is crystal clear and is able to reflect light beautifully. Similarly, when our mind is in a state of sattva, there is absence of dirt in the form of selfish desires. There is brightness because it is able to reflect the light of the self, the awareness of the self, without any hinderance. There is health because it enables us to get as close to our natural state of joy as is possible in the human body.        Now, no matter how enjoyable or pleasant this state is, Shri Krishna reminds us that sattva has the ability to bind us, to trap us, because anyone will like to remain in a state of joy and calmness. Furthermore, if we foresee that this state will go away, we would like to hold on to this state of joy tightly and not let it go. Sattva can also bind us through attachment to knowledge. Since sattva enables our mind to accumulate more and more worldly knowledge, read more books, attain more academic qualifications, and ultimately pump up our ego, we get attached to it even more.        Why is sattva able to bind us to joy and knowledge? We mistake the joy provided by sattva because we have not experienced what real joy is. That can only happen in meditation when we are able to access the joy that is inherent in the \u201cI\u201d, in the self. All other joys are in the realm of Prakriti \u2013 temporary, perishable, and illusory. True joy is in the subject, the \u201cI\u201d, not in the object. Sattva, though preferable to rajas and tamas, is to be used for getting us closer to the goal of liberation, and has to be ultimately discarded, just like the fire is turned off after we cook our meal."

First, he breaks down Prakriti into its three components: the gunaas which are sattva, rajas and tamas. We have to note that the phrase \u201cborn of\u201d in the shloka does not mean that Prakriti creates the three gunaas. It means that Prakriti itself is nothing but the three gunaas. Next, Shri Krishna states the effect of Prakriti on the Purusha, also known as the jeeva, the individual soul. He says that Prakriti binds or ties down the imperishable body dweller, the \u201cdehi\u201d, the jeeva, to the body.        Let us begin by understanding what the term \u201cgunaa\u201d means. From our point of view, gunaa is a state of mind. In just one day, we experience calmness, passion and lethargy, which are roughly equal to sattva, rajas and tamas respectively. From a broader point of view, gunaas refer to building blocks of the universe. Inert matter is tamas, action or dynamism is rajas, and harmony is sattva. Since we are primarily interested in liberation from our sorrow, we shall focus on the impact of the gunaas on our mind rather than their impact on the universe.        Now, if we have repeatedly heard that our self is imperishable and can never be bound, then how can the perishable gunaas bind the self? The answer is : the gunaas by themselves do not bind us. Ignorance of our true nature, followed by our mis-identification with the body, puts us in a situation where we ourselves allow the gunaas to take over control of our life.        Imagine that you have parked your car on the left side of road. A car that looks just like your car is also parked on the same road, but on the right side of the road. After you come out of the building and absent-mindedly think that the other car is yours, you are trapped. You see a new scratch on the car and get upset, you get a parking ticket and have to pay the fine, and so on. The other car has not \u201cbound\u201d you, but your incorrect knowledge has done so. We can also go back to the example of the child watching the boxing match. He is as though glued to the screen, while his grandmother is not. The TV does not bind him since it is is nothing but millions of red, blue and green dots of light. It is the child\u2019s strong identification with the boxer that binds him.        Similarly, the individual soul which has mis-identified itself with the body, gets entrapped in the play of the three gunaas. In the next three shlokas, Shri Krishna takes up each gunaa one by one, and explains its power to bind the body in detail."

Doesn\u2019t it sound far fetched? Something quite similar happens to us every night. When we dream, our minds splits, as it were, into two. One aspect becomes the watcher, and the other aspect projects our dreams. In other words, the mind watches its own show. The Mandukya upanishad provides a detailed comparison of our waking, dreaming and deep sleep states.        Shri Krishna says that Ishvara, having divided himself into his two aspects, is both the mother and father of every thing and every living being in the universe. After he deposits the seeds or the jeevas into Prakriti, he creates the state of Hiranyagarbha. This state contains the potential to generate an entire sequence of creation, sustenance and dissolution of several universes. It is comparable to a DVD that contains within it the potential to create an entire two hour movie with several characters and locations.        Also, the ultimate womb, the ultimate source of the birth of all beings is the great brahman or Prakriti, which is nothing but the three gunaas. If we have to remove the impact and influence that the three gunaas exert upon us, we need to study what they are, how they impact us, how we fall under their sway, and how does one remain unaffected by them. Shri Krishna, having summarized the relevance of the three gunaas, proceeds to analyze the three gunaas in significant detail from the next shloka."

These vaasanaas are created as a result of karma phala or fruits of action. Each action of eating a sweet creates a new desire to eat a sweet later, for instance. One lifetime is not enough to exhaust these vaasanaas, causing the jeeva to continuously take birth in the world to fulfill its desires. This is the explanation of birth and rebirth of jeevas. But how does the universe itself begin? Shri Krishna describes this topic in extremely poetic language in two shlokas.        Ishvara, at the beginning of creation, splits himself into his two aspects. One aspect is Prakriti, referred to here as the \u201cgreat brahman\u201d, which comprises three gunaas or qualities. Prakriti has the power to generate an infinite variety of forms through innumerable permutations and combinations of its three gunaas. But it is inert. It cannot create the universe by itself. The awareness aspect of Ishvara, the kshetrajnya, is needed to infuse Prakriti with life. This happens when Ishvara places all of the jeevas into Prakriti, just like seeds are placed into soil.        Let\u2019s examine this in more detail. How exactly does the jeeva come into contact with Prakriti? It is due to avidyaa or ignorance. Each jeeva\u2019s vaasanaas or unfulfilled desires are caused by its ignorance of its true nature which is infinite. Instead, the jeeva, also known as the Purusha, thinks that it is incomplete, and mistakenly rushes out into Prakriti to make itself complete again. This illusory link between the Purusha and Prakriti becomes the source of its birth and rebirth in the cycle of samsaara."

If an actor is selected to play a part in a well-established and long running soap, they are overjoyed since their career has just skyrocketed. But once the actor is selected, they are afraid when they read each day\u2019s script, since their role can be killed off at any time by the director. The director and actor have two different visions. The director is concerned with moving the story forward, whereas the actor is concerned with preserving his role.        Now, if we identify with the various roles or the various parts that we play each day, we will face a fate similar to that of the actor. We experience birth and death every day, every minute, throughout our lives. When we get a new job, for instance, a new \u201csenior manager of marketing\u201d is born. When we lose that job, that senior manager \u201cdies\u201d. If a marriage happens in the family, several new \u201cin-laws\u201d are born. If something goes wrong in that marriage, all those in-laws \u201cdie\u201d. If something makes us angry, an angry man is born, and will die in a short while once the anger dissipates. Birth and death are part and parcel of Prakriti\u2019s functioning.        Shri Krishna urges us to identify with Ishvara so that we are not disturbed or agitated when any kind of birth or death, even that of our own body, occurs. If the actor has the same vision as the director, he will take the end of his role in good stead and go on to do a wonderful job in his next assignment. If we have removed our ignorance through knowledge, if we have realized our true nature as identical to that of Ishvara, we will see things from Ishvara\u2019s perspective and stop identifying with the ups and downs experienced by our body.        How exactly does this creation, this birth take place? Shri Krishna explains next."

The supreme self, which is our true nature, mistakenly identifies itself with one body within Prakriti or Maaya and becomes the Purusha. It further gets trapped in Prakriti when it gets enchanted by play of the three gunaas of Prakriti. Shri Krishna uses this chapter to explain the nature of these three gunaas, their characteristics, their effects and their remedy in detail.        This shloka is in the form of \u201canubandha chatushtaya\u201d, the four-fold curriculum covered in a text. It systematically lists the subject matter of the chapter, the student who is qualified to study this chapter, the goal of this chapter and the relationship of the subject to the goal. The subject matter is brahmavidyaa or the knowledge of brahman. One who is a muni, one who has a contemplative mind, is fit to study this chapter. The highest accomplishment one can aspire to \u2013 liberation from sorrow \u2013 is the goal of this chapter. When we know brahman as our our own self, the goal is attained. This is the prayojanam, the relationship of the subject matter to the goal of this chapter.        Before the topic is begun, however, we notice that Shri Krishna repeats the statement that he has made in earlier chapters about the glory of this knowledge. He does so because knowledge for us usually means academic, professional or any other type of worldly knowledge. It is always knowledge about some person, object, substance, concept, technique, something that can be accessed with the senses and mind. However, the knowledge of the self is that knowledge that reveals what the subject is, what the \u201cI\u201d is. In order to remove this hard conditioning, this deep programming within us, Shri Krishna has to repeat the importance of this knowledge."

He reminds us that this knowledge is not something new, that it has come directly from the Vedas and the Brahma Sutras. He then describes the field in detail by listing its modifications such as the great elements, the ego, the senses and so on. A list of attributes or qualities that are needed in order to escape the influence of the field is given. These qualities include humility, lack of arrogance and so on. These qualities are termed as \u201cjnyaanam\u201d or means of knowledge.        The topic of the supreme self, brahman, the knower of the field or kshetrajnya, is taken up next. The \u201csat\u201d or existence aspect of brahman is indicated first with attributes such as hands, legs and so on. It is then indicated with negation of those same attributes, following the \u201cadhyaaropa apavaada\u201d technique used in Vedanta. Brahman, which can never become an object of our knowledge, is explained through a series of paradoxes \u2013 it is near, yet it is far and so on. The \u201cchit\u201d or awareness aspect of brahman is also highlighted using the phrase \u201cit is the light of all lights\u201d.        The field and its knower are now explained from the point of view of the individualized self, jeeva by using the terminology of Purusha and Prakriti. Shri Krishna first defines these terms, points out their beginningless nature, and also points out how they become the cause of enjoyership and doership respectively. The fall of the immaculate supreme self is explained by the apparent relationship of Purusha and Prakriti due to ignorance of our true nature as the supreme self that resides as Ishvara in all bodies. Release from this ignorance leads to liberation.        In order to get to a stage where we can discriminate or distinguish between the field and its knower, we have to go through a curriculum of saadhanaa or spiritual practice. Shri Krishna provides this roadmap of steps as karma, bhakti, raaja and saankhya yoga. The key thing, however, is to orient or attach ourselves to the imperishable Ishvara, and to detach ourselves from identification with Prakriti, which is the storehouse of all action and diversity.        Shri Krishna concludes the chapter with two illustrations highlighting the existence and awareness, the sat and chit aspects of the supreme self. The analogy of space is used to illustrate the all-pervading, unattached, untainted and singular nature of the supreme self. The analogy of the sun is used to illustrate the knowledge, awareness and non-acting nature of the supreme self. The chapter ends by asserting that the fruit of knowing the true nature of the supreme self is moksha or liberation."

Shri Krishna concludes this chapter by asserting that the one who has removed his ignorance through knowledge attain the supreme, which is moksha or liberation from the cycle of Prakriti\u2019s creation and dissolution. The key to understanding this chapter is \u201cviveka\u201d, or discrimination, which was hinted at the beginning of this chapter by the words \u201cidam shareera\u201d or \u201cthis body\u201d.        Take the case of a forensic investigator who is hired to detect counterfeit currency notes. On the first day of his job, he will not be able to spot the difference between a fake note and a genuine note. After learning about the visual differences between what\u2019s fake and what\u2019s genuine, and after practising to spot those differences over a period of time, his eye will begin to see minute details that the average eye cannot see. This ability to separate the real from the unreal is discrimination, which is the \u201ceye of wisdom\u201d mentioned in the shloka.        So then, the one who knows how to conduct his life in a manner such that he can distinguish between the unreal aspects and the real aspects, between the field and its knower, between Purusha and Prakriti, and learn to see the imperishable in the perishable as Ishvara, such a person is freed of the mechanisms of Prakriti, the cause of all beings. This is the goal of jnyaana yoga, which is summarized in the thirteenth chapter of the Gita. We will be able to attain this goal if we bring this teaching into our lives through constant reflection and meditation.        om tatsatiti shreematbhagavatgitasupanishadsu brahmavidyaayaam yogashaastre shreekrishnaarjunsamvade kshetrakshetrajnyavibhaagayogo naama trayodashodhyaayaha || 13 ||"

In this shloka, the example of the sun is given to highlight the actionless nature of the self. The sun is located millions of miles away from the earth, yet it enables life on earth to exist. Minerals, plants, animals and humans, everything and every being survives only from the sun\u2019s energy. But the sun never acts. All of the actions happen on our planet distinct and separate from the sun.        Shri Krishna says that the self in us, the \u201cI\u201d in us is similar in nature to the sun. The self or the knower of the field, the kshetrajnya, illumines or knows the actions taking place in the kshetra, the field, our body, which is a part of Prakriti. Furthermore, the self does not take on the notion of pride or doership in the actions of the body, neither does it get differentiated due to the differences or modifications of Prakriti, just like the sun never claims doership nor gets differentiated due to the variety of form on our planet.        So, if the self is the sole knower of all of the actions in our body, how does our intellect know things? With respect to the analogy of the sun, the intellect can be compared to a pool of water that reflects the light of the sun. The intellect is just an instrument that functions due to tje knowledge of the self. If the intellect is calm and steady, it works perfectly in interpreting the information sent to it from the mind and senses. If it is agitated or dull, it cannot work perfectly, just like the sun\u2019s reflection is disturbed when the pool of water is agitated or muddy.        Here, Shri Krishna asserts that the self is of the nature of \u201cchit\u201d. It is knowledge, awareness, consciousness personified."

Space was created first, followed by air, fire, water and then earth, each more tangible and visible than the one preceding it. Space, therefore, is the subtlest of elements. Its main property is indivisibility. We may put up walls and differentiate \u201cmy room\u201d from \u201cyour room\u201d, but the wall does not actually divide space at all. The wall is an upaadhi, something that mentally limits space, but cannot ever limit space in reality.        Another property of space that it is unaffected by whatever it contains. You can throw dust, water, glue, perfume, odour, anything at all into space, yet it remains unaffected. The air in a room may get affected by perfume or odour, not space. But more fundamentally, space provides existence to everything. Without space, no object can ever exist.        Shri Krishna says that the self is similar to space in these aspects. Like space is as though divided into rooms, the self is one but appears as though residing differently in different bodies. Like space never gets tainted by whatever is thrown at it, the self never gets impacted by the results, reactions, experiences and consequences of any action. All actions and reactions stay in the realm of Prakriti. And when we say statements like \u201cthis pot is round\u201d, we should note that we cannot use the word \u201cis\u201d without realizing that the \u201cis\u201d is the \u201csat\u201d or existence aspect of the self.        How should we bring this teaching into our life? Ultimately, all of us are craving for independence of one form or the other. For instance, the incessant drive to earn more wealth is towards gaining financial independence. Shri Krishna says that once we know that the self in us, the \u201cI\u201d in us is totally unaffected by any reaction or experience of the world, we will gain the highest and utmost level of independence, which is moksha or liberation. We just have to work at removing the ignorance of our true nature, which can only happen if we disassociate from Prakriti and associate with Ishvara."

Since this chapter gives prominence to logic, more so than any other chapter in the Gita, he wants to clear any doubts or misconceptions that we may harbour about the supreme self. The first doubt we may have is as follows. If Prakriti is without beginning, and the supreme self is also without beginning, what makes them different?        Shri Krishna says that the difference is cause by whether or not they have gunaas or qualities. So far, we have seen that Prakriti is nothing but the three gunaas of sattva, rajas and tamas. But the supreme self is \u201cnirguna\u201d, it has no association or association with any quality whatsoever. This is what makes it different than Prakriti. Also, Prakriti is constantly changing and perishing whereas the supreme self is imperishable. When something has association with qualities, like the human body has strength, it is bound to perish or decay. Since the supreme self has no qualities at all, it is imperishable. Prakriti, on the other hand, is every changing and perishable.        Another doubt is as follows. Does the supreme self get affected by the actions and reactions of Prakriti? Shri Krishna asserts that it does not. We have seen that the supreme self, due to ignorance, identifies itself with a body, a product of Prakriti.  This is what is referred to in this shloka \u2013 it \u201cresides\u201d in the body. We have also repeatedly heard that the supreme self has nothing to do with Prakriti. It can never become the doer or the enjoyer of any actions. But due to the apparent identification with the body, the supreme self assumes that it is a doer and enjoyer. Since the identification is fake, not real, the supreme self can never get affected by the actions and reactions by Prakriti.        We may have understood the non-doership and non-enjoyership of the supreme self in theory, but it is still a little fuzzy. We need to clearly understand how the supreme self, in its real nature neither acts, nor experiences the results of its actions. To better explain this, Shri Krishna provides an illustration in the next shloka."

Imagine that the same toddler sees a traffic signal for the first time. The signal turns bright red, then green, then orange. Sometimes, the orange light flashes for a few seconds. Sometimes it shows a left arrow, sometimes a right arrow. While the toddler is bewildered by the diversity of colours and lights generated by the traffic signal, we as adults are no longer fascinated by it. We know that the basis of the diversity is 3 bulbs, and some electronic circuit that switches these bulbs on and off.        Similarly, one who knows the workings of Prakriti knows that the whole universe is nothing but a play of the three gunaas or qualities of Prakriti. Inert substances have tamasic predominance. Movement is caused by rajasic predominance. Intelligence is caused by saatvic predominance. These three gunaas are the building blocks of the variety we see in the universe, and it is these three gunaas that have been evolving, changing, combining with each other throughout the timeline of the universe. This Prakriti, the three gunaas, is nothing but a power of Ishvara himself.        So then, how do we reduce our fascination for the three gunaas? Our attitude should be as follows. The variety of the universe, everything that I see, is a product of the three gunaas of Prakriti. This Prakriti is a machine, a mechanism that has been set in motion by Ishvara. But I also know that Ishvara in his purest form is infinite and all-pervading, and that he resides in everyone as the \u201cI\u201d, the self. Therefore, all of this variety and diversity is just an upaadhi, a conditioning of the self. When I see diversity, I am only seeing Ishvara, the self of all.        If we are able to develop this kind of attitude, this kind of knowledge, and stay rooted in it, we will shift our focus to Ishvara who is constant, and not the diversity of Prakriti that is ever changing. We will then attain unity with the eternal essence, with brahman, and achieve liberation."

He is fascinated each time it rings, andmistakenly thinks that by raising his hand, he makes the phone ring. But, if an adult has a never-ending fascination with a phone ringing, or has a mistaken notion about why it rings, we will think that there is something wrong with him. If an adult is overly fascinated by machines, it is because he lets the three gunaas of Prakriti still entice him, attract him. In general, once we know how a machine works, we are not overly fascinated or concerned with it.        Shri Krishna says that one who has truly assimilated the teaching of the Gita knows that actions, reactions, emotions, thought, logic, all these happen in the realm of Prakriti. Just like we lose fascination for machines once we know how they work, we should gradually stop being fascinated by Prakriti which is nothing but a machine that belongs to Ishvara. If this understanding seeps in, the shocks of world that we face daily will slowly lose their ability to shake us. We will perform our duties with our full attention and dedication so that we can exhaust our selfish desires, but leave the reactions and results to Ishvara because it is all happening in his Prakriti, his machine.        How do we go about doing this? The path to reduce our fascination with Prakriti is to increase our fascination with Ishvara. We do this by hearing stories of Ishvara, by attending satsanga, by associating with people who are devotees of Ishvara. The Gita itself contains chapters on the glory of Ishvara\u2019s vibhootis, which can be read as daily meditations. Eventually, we begin to see the entire universe as part of Ishvara\u2019s vishvaroopa, his universal form.        Now, even if we develop detachment towards the actions of Prakriti, our senses still get fascinated by variety, colour, form, diversity created by it. How do we deal with this aspect of Prakriti?

He says that one who sees Ishvara residing equally in everything and everyone, including himself, does not harm or kill his self by his own self. He says that we commit a kind of suicide whenever we do not focus on the imperishable and give too much importance to the perishable. We would very rarely get the urge to commit suicide. So how does this happen?        Whenever our body\u2019s weight increases or decreases, we say \u201cI am fat, I am thin\u201d. Whenever our body falls ill and recovers, we say \u201cI am sick, I am healthy\u201d. Whenever our body is injured and healed, we say \u201cI am injured, I am healed\u201d. We taken on changes that happen to a mass of flesh and bones as our own changes. By repeatedly taking on this identification to the body due to ignorance of our true nature, we get stuck in an endless cycle of desire, action, birth and death. This entry into the cycle of birth and death is referred to as \u201ckilling of one\u2019s self by one\u2019s own self\u201d.        Shri Krishna says that we need to develop samadarshanam, the vision of seeing the imperishable Ishvara in the perishable world. We need to stop identifying with the body, which is not ours to begin with. It belongs to the five elements that make up the universe, and will go back to them when it has run its course. We should identify with Ishvara who exists equally in us and in other beings. When we recognize that the Ishvara in us is the same Ishvara in everyone, we will attain the most supreme, the most pure state of Ishvara which is the state of brahman, the  eternal essence. The instant we realize our identity with brahman, we attain liberation or moksha.        We have seen how to attach ourselves to Ishvara, how to identify ourselves with Ishvara in these shlokas. We also need to detach ourselves from Prakriti. We shall see how to do this in the next two shlokas."

In India, freedom fighters had to urge its citizens to overcome their differences of region and religion, and emphasize the idea of a united Indian nation. Unless the citizens stopped identifying themselves with a certain region/religion and started identifying themselves as Indians, there was no chance of India gaining independence.        Similarly, all of us tend to focus on each others physical appearances, words, ideas, thoughts, all of which are fundamentally perishable and transient. Shri Krishna urges us to develop and attitude where we shift our focus from the perishable to the imperishable. In other words, we learn to see the imperishable Ishvara in everybody and everything, including ourselves. We saw earlier that everything and every being is a combination of the kshetra and the kshetrajnya. We now stop identifying with the imperishable kshetra and start identifying with the imperishable kshetrajnya, which is Ishvara himself.        So then, this is the correct attitude, the correct vision, that we should develop. We are a product of Ishvara and Prakriti, therefore we should identify with the Ishvara aspect as our self, our \u201cI\u201d. In parallel, everything and everyone is also a product of Ishvara and Prakriti, therefore we should emphasize the Ishvara aspect which is present in everyone equally. We will come to the conclusion that the Ishvara aspect in us is the same as the Ishvara aspect in everyone else. Shri Krishna says that one who develops such a vision, one who sees the imperishable in the perishable, he truly sees, not anyone else."

We may be able to experience our true nature as the saakshi, the witness, in deep meditation. But most of us still have to transact in this world, still deal with our friends, our relatives, our co-workers and so on. How should our attitude be towards the world after we have understood, at least in theory, what our true nature is? We cannot, and should not, think of ourselves as something special, and as everyone else as useless forms on an IMAX screen, per the illustration used in previous shlokas. Now, in this sequence of shlokas, we learn to develop the right attitude, the right vision towards the world.        Shri Krishna begins this topic by asserting that every other being in the universe has come into existence just like we have. The kshetrajnya, the higher aspect of Prakriti, has identified itself with the kshetra, the lower aspect of Prakriti. Each such erroneous identification creates the Purusha, also known as the jeeva, the individual soul. Subsequently, each Purusha has developed attachment to the qualities of Prakriti, accumulating selfish desires or karmas in the process. Billions of Purushas live out their lives in this world trying to exhaust their karmas, but in most cases, end up accumulating more karmas, and therefore, take birth again.        We have spoken of this erroneous identification several times, but have not delved into it deeply. The classic example to explain this erroneous identification is that of a burning hot iron ball. The iron ball has taken on heat, which is the property of fire. On the other hand, fire which is normally without shape, has taken on the property of the iron ball, which is round. Two things taking on each other\u2019s properties is known as \u201canyonya adhyaasa\u201d or mutual superimposition. The Purusha\u2019s real nature is infinite, full of knowledge and bliss. Prakriti\u2019s nature is finite, inert and sorrowful. Erroneous identification results in them exchanging their properties, as it were. This is how the Purusha assumes inertness of the body.        So our daily life is nothing but a Purusha interacting with several other Purushas, all of which are under the effect of this erroneous identification. There should be no hint of any arrogance that causes us to treat others differently just because we think that we have acquired more knowledge than them. In fact, whenever we emphasize differences between one another rather than similarities, even in worldly matters, we slip further away from liberation. But, developing an attitude of sameness towards everyone becomes difficult, especially when our minds are conditioned to differentiate rather than unify. Keeping this in mind, we learn to develop the correct attitude towards the world in the next shloka."

We either listen to the advice of an expert, or read a book written by an expert. We study their teachings, we put their teachings into practice. Slowly, we begin to understand what they are talking about, and someday, become an expert ourselves. All this becomes possible only when we have faith in the teacher, and when we diligently follow their instructions. The forum in which we obtain knowledge through contact with knowers of that which is the ultimate reality, the \u201csanga\u201d with the \u201csat\u201d, is known as \u201csatsanga\u201d.        Shri Krishna says that if we are not qualified to follow any of the techniques mentioned in the previous shloka \u2013 dhyaana, saankhya or karma yoga \u2013 we need not worry. We can obtain the same result of those techniques if we find a competent guru and diligently follow the path prescribed by them. Just hearing the teaching is not enough. If the doctor gives you a list of foods to avoid eating, you will not improve your health unless you follow their instructions. Similarly, we must become \u201cshruti paraayanaha\u201d, uphold the teachings as the ultimate goal of our lives. Satsanga should become an integral part of our lives.        So then, what is the result of those who follow this path? They will be able to overcome death, in other words, they will achieve liberation. Death does not just refer to the loss of the physical body. Every time we get fascinated by the material world and rush to act with selfish desires, we forget our true nature and take on the role of a doer, an experiencer, a meritorious actor or \u201cpuntyaatmaa\u201d or a sinner. Each time we forget our true nature as the blissful eternal essence to rush out into the world and eventually experience sorrow, we \u201cdie\u201d as it were. So therefore, Shri Krishna says that one who simply follows the instructions of their guru diligently will overcome death.        In these two shlokas, Shri Krishna covered the types of spiritual techniques required to access the Purusha within. He now begins a new topic in the next shloka."

One one hand, we studied techniques such as saankhya yoga, karma yoga, dhyaana yoga or meditation and bhakti yoga as techniques to access Ishvara. One the other hand, we came across the two-fold downfall of the Purusha, through ignorance of our true nature and subsequent attachment to the gunaas or qualities. In this shloka and the next, Shri Krishna methodically connects these seemingly unrelated topics.          Before we are ready to remove the ignorance of our true nature, we need to deal with our attachment to the three gunaas of Prakriti. In simple terms, we need to deal with our selfish desires. The technique of dealing with our selfish desires depends upon the capability of the seeker. Shri Krishna says that the most advanced seeker has mastered the technique of dhyaana yoga or meditation. They can directly contact the eternal essence \u201cin the self through the self\u201d, which means that they can access the eternal essence through their intellect. This topic was covered in the sixth chapter.        For those who do not have mastery over meditation, saankhya yoga or the yoga of discrimination is recommended. This was the topic of the second chapter. Here, the seeker has great command over their intellect. They can constantly separate the eternal essence from the three gunas, the Purusha from Prakriti, through viveka or discrimination. \u201cThe three gunaas, sattva, rajas and tamas are objects of my perception, I am their witness, eternal and distinct from them.\u201d This is how they think all the time. Some commentators interpret the phrase \u201csaankhya and yoga\u201d to include \u201cashtanga yoga\u201d, which is the technique of accessing Ishvara through yogic exercises and breathing.        For those who cannot practise saankhya yoga or ashtanga yoga, karma yoga, the yoga of selfless action, is recommended.  This was the topic of the third chapter. Most of us fit into this category. When actions are performed with the idea of dedication to Ishvara, the mind is gradually purged of selfishness. Such a pure mind becomes ready to receive and internalize the knowledge of one\u2019s true nature described in the present chapter.        Now, what happens if we cannot follow any of these techniques? Shri Krishna explains the simplest technique in the next shloka."

It says that each of us comes with three types of karmas, which are unfulfilled desires that become seeds of future actions. Total karmas or \u201csanchita\u201d karmas are the entire stock of our karmas. Present life karmas or \u201cprarabdha\u201d karmas are those karmas that are activated in our present life. Expected karmas or \u201cagaami\u201d karmas are those karmas that will be generated due to the results of actions in the present life. These karmas get added to our sanchita karmas, our stock of karmas.        As an illustration, consider this. The arrows in an archer\u2019s quiver are sanchita karmas, the arrows that have left his bow are prarabdha karmas, and the arrows that are loaded on the bow are agaami karmas. The Vedas assert that so long as an individual maintains a stock of karmas, he has to take on a body to exhaust those karmas. In each birth, a portion of the stock of karmas is allocated to the individual so that he can exhaust them. By generating further selfish desires, the individual adds to his stock of karmas, and the cycle of birth goes on indefinitely.        Shri Krishna says that the one who has properly understood the relationship between Purusha and Prakriti, one who has understood the identification of the eternal essence with Prakriti due to ignorance and the consequent rushing after the gunaas, is never born again. This means that his stock of karmas is destroyed, just like a spark of fire destroys dry hay. He does not generate any further selfish desires, because he is no longer fascinated by the play of the three gunaas. Why does this happen? When one realizes that selfish desire is created by ignorance of one\u2019s true nature, it wipes out any notion of selfishness completely. There is no longer an urge to come into contact with Prakriti.         Now, this person still has to deal with his prarabdha. His present life karmas continue to be active until his body drops off, after which he does not have to take any further births. The word \u201capi\u201d in the shloka indicates that the individual can continue to perform his duties even if he has realized his true nature as the eternal essence, just like king Janaka continued to rule his kingdom even though he had achieved liberation.        Shri Krishna concludes the topic of Purusha and Prakriti with this shloka."

Next, the association asks him permission to host their next weekly meeting in your apartment, which he readily agrees to. He is so excited about the meeting that he prepares tea and snacks for them. By the next weekly meeting, he has become so involved in the association meetings that he feels the need to vote on issues that he strongly feels about. He gets so involved that it is just a matter of time before he is elected president of the apartment complex association.        Your grandfather, who had nothing whatsoever to do with the building, started out as a pure witness, then become the permitter, nourisher, experiencer and subsequently the master of the building association. Similarly, Shri Krishna says that the eternal essence that has nothing whatsoever to do with Prakriti, develops a strong identification with a body. By taking various upaadhis or conditionings such as the body, the mind, the vital forces, the intellect and so on, it becomes the permitter, the nourisher, the experiencer and the master of this body, just like your grandfather took on various roles as a member of the apartment complex association.        Practically speaking, we don\u2019t need to worry too much about this. All that we need to know that we don\u2019t have to go out into the world hunting for Ishvara. Ishvara is resident in our body as the permitter, nourisher, experiencer and so on. He is the paramaatmaa, the supreme self resident as the \u201cI\u201d in all beings. This is how we have to understand what Purusha means. The more we pay attention to the Ishvara aspect in us, the less importance we give to the upaadhis, especially the ego. People who have reached the pinnacle of their spiritual journey eventually lose their individuality and themselves become the universal witness, the upadrashtaa, remaining unaffected by the goings on of Prakriti."

One brother is a huge fan of boxer A, and the other brother of boxer B. The two brothers get so involved in the match that they feel they themselves are in the boxing ring. The brothers start throwing punches in the air, mimicking the actions of the boxers. Also, when boxer A punches boxer B, the first brother feels exhilaration whereas the second brother feels pain. All this time, their grandmother is watching the match without any of these reactions.           This involvement with the boxers doesn\u2019t end with the match. Boxer A always likes to wear a headband, so the first brother starts to wear headbands in the house. Boxer B always snaps his fingers at the end of every sentence, so the second brother begins to do that as well, much to the annoyance of his parents. Both the brothers have become so infatuated with their boxers that they take on their likes and dislikes. We may think that such behaviour only happens with children and teenagers, but something similar has happened to all of us, causing us to get trapped in samsaara.        We are stuck twice in samsaaraa. First, Shri Krishna says that the eternal essence has mistakenly identified itself with one body due to avidyaa or ignorance, just like the brother identified himself with boxer A. Instead of watching the IMAX movie of the universe like the grandmother, we get stuck to one character in that movie. When the eternal essence as though gets deluded with ignorance, it becomes the Purusha, and becomes \u201cseated in Prakriti\u201d. It forgets it real nature as infinite, indivisible and blissful. It assumes the properties of our body and thinks itself to be  finite, divisible and sorrowful.        Second, having identified with a finite body, having taken the \u201cupaadhi\u201d or conditioning of a body, we get attached to the play of Prakriti, the play of the three gunaas or qualities. We get so attached to the forms of Prakriti that we generate selfish desires in order to repeatedly contact these forms, which are nothing but objects and people. Seeking a shinier car is a mistaken attempt to find joy in the car instead of understanding our true nature as joy itself. We become the brother who starts wearing a headband to feel happy, just because boxer A does so, when the brother was happy even before he know what boxing was.        So then, how do we get out of this two step problem of samsaara which causes us to \u201ctake birth in good and evil wombs\u201d? We solve step one \u2013 attachment to gunaas \u2013 through vairaagya or dispassion, we learn to slowly wean ourselves off the influence of the three gunaas. We then solve step two \u2013 ignorance of our true nature \u2013 through jnyaana or knowlege, when we learn of our real nature as the eternal essence and internalize it through meditation.          An illustration of Purusha getting entangled in Prakriti is taken up next."

We are now coming back to the topic that was hinted upon in the karma yoga chapter. Typically, most of us attribute the agency, or the doership of our actions, to our own self. We say \u201cI did this\u201d, \u201cI did not do that\u201d and so on. Shri Krishna makes it perfectly clear that the intellect, the ego and the mind in our body receive input from our senses, filter it through our vaasanaas, and send instructions to our organs of action. All this is going on within the realm of Prakriti, that continues projecting the IMAX movie of the world. In other words, the \u201cI\u201d does not do anything, but Prakriti does everything.        Next, the role of the Purusha is described. The Purusha is the awareness principle, the knowledge principle present in the body. From our perspective, he is concerned with the experience of only one body out of the millions of bodies in that IMAX movie \u2013 our body. What is his role? His role is to know. If we put a drop of a bitter liquid on our tongue, it sends an electrical current to the mind based on the chemical makeup of the bitter liquid. But ultimately, it is only the Purusha that has the capacity to come up with the knowledge that \u201cthis liquid is bitter\u201d. On one level, Purusha knows what the senses and the mind report. Without the Purusha, there will be nothing to know what Prakriti has projected. It would be like projecting a movie without an audience to see it.        So then, when this knowledge of bitterness is filtered through our vaasanaas or our \u201cprogramming\u201d, it can result in either joy or sorrow. Some of us like bitter taste, some of us don\u2019t. This difference comes from the variety in our vaasanaas, our individual programming. So whenever external objects are arranged by Prakriti in a pattern that is conducive to our vaasanaas, the Purusha experiences joy. In other words, whenever we say \u201cI am happy\u201d, it is the Purusha experiencing happiness. Similarly, sorrow is also experienced when objects are undesirable.        Here, encapsulated in these two lines of this shloka, is the state of our lives. Our body with its organs interacts with other bodies in this world. It performs actions whose results are experienced by the Purusha as joy and sorrow. The cycle of joy and sorrow continues from one action to another action, from one experience to another experience. This is \u201csamsaara\u201d.        Now, there seems to be a problem. Right from the second chapter, we have been told that our true nature is the eternal essence. It pervades the entire universe. It is eternal, indestructible and indivisible. We have also been told that Prakriti, through some inexplicable magic, projects the entire universe of names and forms. How then, does the third entity called Purusha come into being? And also, how does it take on one body out of all the bodies in the world as its own, and experience only that body\u2019s joy and sorrow?        Shri Krishna reveals the root cause of samsaara, of our repeated experience of joy and sorrow, in the next shloka."

In many respects, this topic is a continuation of the discussion of higher and lower prakriti from the seventh chapter. Let us quickly recap what we saw there. We learnt about two aspects of Ishvara, the lower and the higher. The lower nature comprises the five elements plus the mind, ego and intellect. The higher nature comprises the life-giving force which is also the experiencer, the subject. In this manner, Ishvara is established as the ultimate cause of the universe.        Here, the lower nature is termed \u201cPrakriti\u201d and the higher nature is termed \u201cPurusha\u201d. First, Shri Krishna says that both these aspects of Ishvara are without beginning, they are eternal. This is because Ishvara himself is eternal, so it logically follows that his aspects must also be eternal. But we also have to note that something which has no beginning can have an end. We will come back to this point later in the discussion.        The second statement here states that all modifications and qualities are born out of Prakriti. Maaya and prakriti refer to the same thing. Prakriti is a power wielded by Ishvara. It is beyond the comprehension of our intellect since our intellect itself is a product of Prakriti. The only way to understand Prakriti is to think of it as a magician\u2019s illusion. This Prakriti gives rise to five elements that produce the entire visible universe. These combinations or modifications of Prakriti are termed as \u201cvikaaraas\u201d. Prakriti also comprises the three \u201cgunaas\u201d or qualities which are sattva, rajas and tamas. These qualities manifest as mental states such as happiness, sorrow and attachment.        In other words, if we go back in time, if we press the rewind button, we will see that everything merges back into Prakriti, everything has come from Prakriti. Now, let us get practical. Whenever we experience emotions such as sorrow, grief, anger and so on, it is Prakriti that creates it, not the self, not the \u201cI\u201d. This is what was explained in the shloka. But, when anger arises in our mind, for instance, we always say \u201cI am angry\u201d. How do we come to the conclusion that the \u201cI\u201d is angry when it is Prakriti that created the anger? This is taken up next."

He spoke about \u201ckshetra\u201d, the field, in shlokas five and six. The field comprises twenty four aspects which are the building blocks of the universe. This includes the five great elements, the intellect and others. The field also comprises seven modifications by which the individual comes into contact with the world. These include desire, hatred and others. The field works like a machine, but is devoid of awareness in itself and is inert. It need to borrow awareness from some other source. This source is the eternal essence, it is \u201cjneyam\u201d, that which is to be known. The field acts as an upaadhi, something which as though limits and conditions the eternal essence.        If we are attracted by the dance of an ocean\u2019s waves, we will never be able to appreciate the grandeur and beauty of the entire ocean, because our attention will be on the waves which are upaadhis that as though limit our understanding of the ocean. Similarly, if we need to understand the eternal essence, we have to learn how to gradually minimize the impact of the upaadhis of the field, and shift our attention to the eternal essence. \u201cJnyaanam\u201d, the means of knowledge that enables us to mentally remove these upaadhis, is elaborated in shlokas seven to eleven.        Once we have learnt how to mentally remove upaadhis, we are ready to understand the eternal essence. From shlokas twelve to seventeen, Shri Krishna uses paradoxes and contradictions to explain the nature of the eternal essence. Our intellect is a product of the field, and will never grasp what the eternal essence is. Paradoxical statements like \u201cit is near, yet it is far\u201d are used so that our intellect doesn\u2019t mistakenly turn the eternal essence into yet another concept.        Shri Krishna says that those who have inquired into the eternal essence in the manner prescribed above are qualified to attain the state of Ishvara, which is liberation. But this state cannot be attained unless we become devotees of Ishvara. A devotee means one who knows that whatever he sees, hears or touches is nothing but Ishvara, and that Ishvara is residing in him as his self. Only one who has such a firm conviction through meditation that everything, including himself, is ultimately Ishvara, will attain liberation.        Now, does all this explanation help me understand what ultimately causes me to experience sorrow in my life? In the next shloka, Shri Krishna begins a new topic to explain this issue in detail."

Here, the \u201cchit\u201d or awareness aspect is elaborated upon. Awareness or sentience is what makes an entity know about it surroundings as well about itself, as we had seen earlier. Shri Krishna says that the eternal essence is the \u201clight among all the lights\u201d. The word \u201clight\u201d in the Vedas refers to awareness, to knowledge. Which means that ultimately, it is the eternal essence that provides the power of awareness, the power to know, to all beings. Without the eternal essence, we would have no awareness, no sentience.        Imagine a classroom of students that are taking an examination. The student on the last bench can see all of the students in front of him. The student seated in the second to last row can see other students, but not the last row student. Also, the student in the front row cannot see the student in the last row. The awareness provided by the eternal essence is like the student in the last row. The next student is the intellect, followed by the mind and the senses. In other word, the eternal essence gives awareness to the intellect, which gives it to the mind, and then to the senses. But the mind, intellect and senses cannot immediately contact the eternal essence.        Now, just like the word \u201clight\u201d refers to knowledge, the word \u201cdarkness\u201d refers to ignorance. By saying that the eternal essence is beyond ignorance, Shri Krishna points out the uniqueness of the awareness aspect of the eternal essence. If we light a lamp in a dark room, it dispels the darkness. We cannot have darkness and light coexist. However, the eternal essence is present in individuals who are ignorance of it, as well as those few rare individuals who have realized it. This unique ability of the eternal essence to illumine ignorance is why Shri Krishna calls it \u201cbeyond darkness\u201d.        So, how can we use our antahakarana, our intellect, mind and senses, to realize that eternal essence? Shri Krishna provides a three step process. We use \u201cjnyaanam\u201d, the means of knowledge indicated in the twenty attributes such as humility mentioned earlier in the chapter, to gradually reduce the importance we give to upaadhis or conditionings. As we systematically study the scriptures under the guidance of a teacher, the eternal essence comes into our awareness as \u201cjneyam\u201d, the object of knowledge. But only through constant contemplation, reflection and meditation does the eternal essence becomes \u201cjnyaanagamyam\u201d, the goal of knowledge, where all notions of duality are removed and we remain established in the eternal essence.         Shri Krishna concludes this shloka by reminding us that all these three stages \u2013 preparation, study and reflection \u2013 are enabled only through the intellect, which is referred to here as the \u201chridi\u201d or heart of all human beings. Only humans have the capability to access the eternal essence. That is why we come across the statement \u201ca human birth is rare to attain\u201d in many prominent spiritual texts."

Here he further describes the distortion created by upaadhis or conditionings in our understanding of the eternal essence. He begins by asserting that the eternal essence is undivided, it is unbroken and continuous. It cannot be chopped up into pieces. But due to the effect of space as an upaadhi, it appears as if the eternal essence exists differently in various beings.         We can go back to the example of the clay pot and space. If we have a hundred pots on the floor, it appears as though the space in the room is divided into a hundred \u201cpot-spaces\u201d, due to the boundary created by the wall of each pot. But in reality, space can never be divided or chopped up. Or we can also look at the example of electricity, which looks like it functions differently in each appliance, but is really one continuous circuit that begins at the power plant. If our senses cannot access upaadhis such as pots or appliances, they mistakenly assume that subtle things such as space and electricity are absent. Similarly, the body of a living entity serves as an upaadhi where we can feel the presence of the eternal essence.        So if there is only one continuous and undivided eternal essence, how do we account for all of the creation, sustenance, and destruction of names and forms in the universe? Shri Krishna says that ultimately, it is the eternal essence that provides the foundation for the lifecycle of the universe. Waves are created, sustained and dissolved back into the ocean. If we pay attention to the waves, we lose sight of the ocean that is one undivided foundation which is behind all of the waves. We come back to the same point again : the eternal essence provides existence, the \u201cis-ness\u201d, to all names and forms in the universe.        Now, if the eternal essence cannot be comprehended by the senses, is it dark and empty like a black hole? This is clarified in the next shloka."

However, we need to continuously remind ourselves that the eternal essence is neither an object nor a concept that can be grasped by the mind. Shri Krishna uses the Upanishadic style of describing the eterna essence through contradictions and paradoxes in this sequence of shlokas, and especially in the current shloka.         The first contradiction mentioned is that the eternal essence is both inside and outside all inert and living entities. This point cautions us against conceptualizing the eternal essence as limited by space, as if it is only available in one location and not the other. A somewhat crude analogy is mobile phone signals, which are essentially radio waves. Radio waves are all-pervasive and they penetrate all solid objects, enabling us to make phone calls from inside as well as outside buildings.         The second contradiction is that the eternal essence is to be known as the ultimate knowledge, yet it is beyond comprehension, due to its subtle nature. Using the radio waves analogy, we can say that none of our senses can detect radio waves. But if we know how to build a device that can access radio waves, we can harness their power to our advantage. Similarly, the eternal essence remains beyond the comprehension of those who have not purified their mind. But for those who have purified their mind, and followed a systematic method of enquiry under the guidance of scriptures and a teacher, it is ever accessible.        This leads us to the third contradiction. For those who have enquired about the nature of the eternal essence systematically, it is immediately available at all times as the self, the \u201cI\u201d within us. But for those who are ignorant, it is far away. Shankaraachaarya says that it is unattainable even in millions of years for such people. Whenever we focus on names and forms, we lose sight of the self. But when we remove the upaadhis of names and forms, we come back to the self, the \u201cI\u201d, that is behind all the names and forms, just like the movie screen.        Note that any time we use analogies such as radio waves, we are trying to conceptualize the eternal essence which is beyond all conception. We need to consider such analogies as helpful pointers, and nothing more."

Similarly, when we hear a description of the eternal essence, we also will have questions and doubts. Shri Krishna now continues to proceed step by step towards explaining jneyam, the knowable which is the eternal essence, by answering three questions with respect to its relationship with the organs of sense (eyes, mouth etc) and organs of action (hands, legs etc).        First question: Can the eternal essence exist without the organs? Shri Krishna says that the eternal essence can exist without the organs of action and sense, it is \u201cdevoid of the senses\u201d, just like electricity can exist without the bulb. Organs of sense and action are one of the means by which the eternal essence expresses itself. It has the power to adapt itself to any form of expression, any upaadhi, just like electricity can power a heater as well as an air conditioner.         Then, can the organs of sense and action exist without the eternal essence? The answer is no, since the eternal essence is \u201csarvabhrit\u201d, the supporter of all upaadhis in the form of \u201cis-ness\u201d or existence. In any language including English, we cannot say something exists without using the word \u201cis\u201d in some shape or form. The \u201cis-ness\u201d of everything is provided by the eternal essence, like the water provides \u201cis-ness\u201d to the wave. But the eternal essence always remains \u201casakta\u201d or detached from the upaadhis, just like a movie screen remains detached from the movie.        Now, we know from earlier chapters that the senses are made up of the three qualities or gunaas : sattva, rajas and tamas. They go out into the world to chase sense objects, which are also made up of the very same gunaas. \u201cGunaa guneshu vartante\u201d, the qualities are playing with the qualities. How does the eternal essence fit into this play of the senses?         Shri Krishna says that even these three qualities are upaadhis, and therefore, the eternal essence is \u201cnirgunam\u201d, not attached to these qualities. When the senses play with their sense objects, the upaadhis of sattva, rajas and tamas are transformed into the upaadhis of joy, sorrow, delusion and so on. The mind, when it participates in this process, becomes the experiencer on account of presence of the eternal essence.          In all of these three answers, we find that the eternal essence is always unattached, whether it is to the organs of sense and actions, to their sense objects or to the three qualities. But when the eternal essence takes on the conditioning or the upaadhi of the organs, it as though moves, and it as though supports their existence. Also, when the eternal essence takes on the upaadhis of the three gunaas, it as though becomes the experiencer. The key here is the phrase \u201cas though\u201d, since this addition or superimposition of upaadhis is only due to ignorance.        Let us now recap Shri Krishna\u2019s explanation so far. In the last shloka, he said that the eternal essence is that which has hands, legs, eyes, mouth etc. In this shloka, he says that the eternal essence is that which has hands, legs, eyes, mouth etc as upaadhis or conditionings. In other words, he first said that the organs exist, and now he negates them by making them upaadhis. This process of assertion and negation is a technique known as \u201cadhyaaropa apavaada\u201d, a step by step means of getting closer and closer to the eternal essence."

The teacher does not directly tell him that \u201celectricity is defined as a form of energy resulting from the existence of charged particles such as electrons or protons\u201d. The teacher uses what the child already knows and imparts the knowledge to him step by step. So the teacher may first say that to the child: wherever you see bright light in a bulb, that is electricity. Once the child has grasped this concept, then the teacher may say: wherever you see wires connected, that is electricity. Slowly, as the child is able to understand the nuances of atoms and electrons, the teacher then reveals to him the technical definition.        Shri Krishna uses a similar process to gently reveal the nature of brahman, the eternal essence, also known as \u201cjnyeyam\u201d or the knowable, to us. Now, it is quite easy for us to see action and sentience \u2013 the power to experience things \u2013 in living creatures everywhere. So Shri Krishna says that wherever we see action in living beings, symbolically represented by the phrase \u201chands and legs\u201d, we should recognize the presence of the eternal essence. Furthermore, wherever we see sentience in living beings, symbolically represented by the phrase \u201ceyes, heads, mouths and ears\u201d, we should recognize the presence of the eternal essence.         Going back to the example of the child learning electricity, the child may sometimes think that the electricity in a bulb is different than the electricity in a fan, or that the bulb limits the flow of electricity to the fan. To remove any similar misconceptions about the eternal essence, Shri Krishna says that the eternal essence pervades everywhere. In other words, it is only one eternal essence that is functioning through the organs of knowledge and action of all living creatures in all of the worlds, and that one organ does not limit the functioning of the eternal essence in another organ.         An example commonly used to illustrate this notion is that of space and pot-space. The space that is in a clay pot and the space outside it is the same. But just because the walls of the pot surround it, we label the space inside as \u201cpot-space\u201d. The pot is a classic example of an upaadhi, something that as though limits the space in it, but does not do so in reality. Space, then, pervades all pots. Similarly, the organs of all living creatures may seem to limit the eternal essence, but not so in reality.        Having established the starting point for realizing the eternal essence, Shri Krishna goes one step further in the next shloka."

He then set to list out various aspects of the field, which are also known as upaadhis or conditionings. This list included upaadhis such as the intellect, the mind, the five elements and so on. Shri Krishna also asserted there is only one knower of the field that is limited or conditioned by all of these upaadhis. He then gave us twenty attributes that we should cultivate in order to reduce the importance we give to these upaadhis, so that we can slowly uncover and get to the kshetrajnya, the knower of the field.        After assuming that we have cultivated these twenty qualities, and consequently learned how to reduce the importance of the field in our lives, Shri Krishna now gets to the main topic of this chapter. He says that he will now reveal what is the real knowledge, what all of us should know in this world as the culmination of all of our knowledge, what is \u201cjneyam\u201d. We learn so many things in our life through schools, colleges, professional training, street smarts and so on. But none of them can give us immortality. None of them can give us a permanent solution from the sorrows that we experience day in and day out. Each time we leave our self and go through our senses into the world to fulfill a desire, we generate sorrow, we create \u201cdeath\u201d in each such departure.        So then, what is this immortality-giving knowledge? Shri Krishna says that it is brahman, which is the very same eternal essence that is within us, and within everything else in the universe. It is \u201cparam\u201d or supreme, beyond which nothing else needs to be known. It is \u201canadimat\u201d, eternal, without any beginning, beyond all notions of time. It is not manifest, which means it is not accessible to the senses or the mind as an object of perception or a thought. But it is also not unmanifest. For instance, our unfulfilled desires lie dormant in our unconscious mind, but do not manifest as thoughts in our mind. The eternal essence is beyond our unconscious as well.        We now see why it is so difficult to understand the eternal essence. It is not like any object or form that can be described in words. It is also not an abstract concept that can be explained through logic, or by comparing it to something else or by combining one concept with another. In earlier chapters we saw how such situations can be handled with negation. If we want to instruct someone on how to select a maroon shirt, we tell them ignore all of the other colours of shirts. The one that is left will be the maroon shirt. Similarly, the eternal essence cannot be comprehended by our mind and senses because it is beyond the mind and senses. It can only be attained through negating everything that is not the eternal essence \u2013 by negating the upaadhis or fields.           Now, in the upcoming shlokas, Shri Krishna proceeds step by step to negate the upaadhis of the eternal essence, starting with the most visible ones."

For instance, once we know that the sun is a star and that the earth revolves around it, we never forget it, even when we appreciate the beauty of a sunrise or a sunset. Similarly, we can mourn the loss of a loved one, without letting that incident obscure our knowledge that the human body is ephemeral.          \u201cTattva jnyaana artha\u201d is the goal or the culmination of the knowledge of reality, which is moksha or liberation. We will constantly contemplate on the self only if we feel that liberation is worthwhile, that it is valuable. On the other hand, if we value material goals more than liberation, we will waver in our commitment to inquiring about the self. Therefore, if we are able to make liberation our end goal, we will easily practice all the other attributes that we have studied in the previous few shlokas.        Shri Krishna concludes this topic by asserting that what has been spoken of so far is the means of knowledge, it is jnyaanam. Anything that does not provide this means of knowledge is ignorance, it is ajnyaanam, it will only serve to further entangle us in the material world. For instance, if we practice arrogance instead of humility, that is out of ignorance. It will lead us away from the path of liberation. We are urged to lead an intelligent, ignorance-free life in the Gita, right from the beginning when Shri Krishna glorified buddhi yoga in the second chapter.         So then, if all this was the means of knowledge, what knowledge does it reveal to us? This topic is taken up next."

He stresses upon the importance of single-pointed devotion by bringing up the word \u201cvyabhichaari\u201d. At one level it means wavering or unsteady, but at another level it refers to someone who is unfaithful to their spouse. True devotion to Ishvara has to be \u201cavyabhichaari\u201d or unwavering, where there is no \u201canya\u201d, no other goal such as getting good marks in our exams, or generating extra profit in our business. We only ask such material goals when we doubt the omniscience, the all-knowing nature of Ishvara.        \u201cVivikta desha\u201d refers to a location that is pure and conducive to meditation and contemplation. But this does not suggest retiring to a forest. It means finding a time and place everyday where we can be free of distractions such as cell phones, television and Internet. If we are constantly pulled into the world by such distractions, contemplation upon Ishvara becomes impossible. But if we spend ten to fifteen minutes without any distractions, and make it a habit, we will automatically begin the process of quietening our mind and contemplating upon Ishvara.        \u201cJana samsad\u201d means assembly of people. And we all know that wherever two or three people meet without any agenda, there is going to be discussion about all the goings on in the world, or even gossip. This assembly of people forces one to join in the conversation and again get sucked into praakrita or material interests. Now \u201cratihi\u201d means one who revels. So therefore, one who prefers not to indulge in such gossip is called \u201cjanasamsadi aratihi\u201d. In fact, as our devotion towards Ishvara increases, interest for external stimuli, including meeting constantly, will slowly subside.        Shri Krishna adds two more attributes in the next shloka to conclude this topic."

The first one is asaktihi, a detached attitude towards people, objects and situations. Aasakti is extreme attachment whereas asakti is lack of attachment. Only when we are away from our daily routine, perhaps on vacation or on a retreat, do we know our level of dependence, and even addiction, to objects, people and situations. Beginning from a cup of coffee in the morning to television in the evening, we rely on external factors to give us joy, and conversely, experience sorrow when they are not available for our enjoyment.         A particularly difficult type of attachment is the strong identification we have with our immediate family and home, which is why Shri Krishna has specifically called it out in this shloka. \u201cAbhishvangaha\u201d is the placement of our future comfort, joy and happiness in our spouse, our children and our home. It is the thought that \u201cin my old age, I do not have to worry, my spouse, or my child will take care of everything, and I can retire in my house peacefully\u201d. This kind of identification is one step worse than attachment, because we do not see any difference between us and our spouse, our children and our home. Any sorrow that affects our spouse becomes our own sorrow. We should of course partake in joy and sorrow with our family members, but only to the extent of our responsibilities. If we go overboard, we will not be able to negate this aspect of kshetra, and consequently, not be able to contemplate the eternal essence. \u201cAnabhishvangaha\u201d is one who can remain detached in this situation.        The third quality mentioned here is \u201csamachittatvam\u201d, maintaining equanity of mind in favourable or unfavourable situations. Shri Krishna has stressed this qualiti repeatedly in various contexts. Even in the very beginning, in the second chapter, he praised equanimity by saying \u201csamatvam yoga ucchyate\u201d. Now, he urges us to maintain this attitude at all times. This can only work if we figure out how to prevent our mind from labelling situations as favourable or unfavourable. One way of doing so is to submit all the results of actions to Ishvara as an offering, and accept any situation as a blessing from him. We can also train our mind through intense meditation to stop this sort of labelling."

Here he lists dispassion of sense objects, absence of ego and investigation into the modifications of the human body as three further attributes in addition to the nine mentioned in the previous shloka.        We have five sense organs that can contact the world and perceive objects. They have raaga (attraction), dvesha (hatred) or viraaga (indifference) towards objects. If we see a lump of clay, for example, we have neither attraction or hatred towards it. The mind is not disturbed when the senses remain free of the labelling of raaga or dvesha. When our senses develop indifference towards every object that they perceive, it is the state of vairagyam or dispassion towards sense objects. So, regardless of whether the object in question is in front of us or someone reminds us of that object, our mind remains unaffected by its presence.        Previously, we came across the term \u201cabhimaan\u201d which meant a sense of mine-ness towards external attributes such as wealth, power, position and so on. \u201cAhankaara\u201d in this context is a stronger form of abhimaan where we develop a sense of mine-ness towards our own body, mind and intellect. If one has pride about a gold medal in mathematics, that is abhimaaan. But if one is proud about one\u2019s intelligence, that is ahankaara. Anahankaara is the absence of such pride, and it is born out of constant dispassion or vairagya towards the body and its temporary nature. Moreover, even a simple bit of contemplation will reveal that for the majority of the population, there is always someone who will eventually overtake us with a better body, mind and intellect.         So far we came across pleasure derived out of sense objects, as well as pride in the functioning of the body, mind and intellect. Both these notions stem from the assumption that our body will remain healthy and fit eternally. But, even if we walk the corridor of any hospital for five minutes, we see the silliness in holding on to that assumption. \u201cDosha-anudarshanam\u201d is the constant, repeated perception of sorrow in all of these states of the body, not just when we visit the hospital. Now, although we consider disease, old age and death as sorrowful, Shri Krishna adds birth to this list as well. It is full of suffering for both the child and the mother. In the Dasbodh of Swami Ramdas, as well as the Shiva Apraadha Stotram of Shankaraachaarya, there is an elaborate description of the painful process of birth."

Shri Krishna began this chapter with a brief explanation of what is the field or kshetra, and who is its knower or kshetragnya. He then asserted that there is only one knower of all the fields in the universe. After that, he categorized twenty four items that can be each considered as a field. From this shloka, Shri Krishna changes the topic from theoretical description to extremely practical techniques that help us bring this teaching into our daily lives. These techniques train us to spot the field or upaadhi that we are giving importance and subsequently reduce the level of importance we give to it. The less importance we give to any of these twenty four upaadhis, the closer we are to realizing our oneness with the eternal essence that is beyond any field or upaadhi.        \u201cMaana\u201d means overestimation of one\u2019s own self-worth. This self-worth can be derived from health, wealth, power, beauty, control, position, any of these characteristics. Acknowledgement that we have one or more of these characteristics, a correct assessment of these characteristics is fine, but when pride or \u201cabhimaan\u201d derived from these characteristics makes us crave extra attention or put down someone else, it is to be avoided. \u201cAmaanitvam\u201d is an absence of pride about any of the above-mentioned characteristics. \u201cDambha\u201d means pretentiousness or falsehood. In the case of abhimaana, we had some characteristic in us that made us puff up with pride. In dambha, we derive a false sense of pride where there is no positive trait to speak of whatsoever. It is completely hollow pride. We see examples in bollywood movies where the boy will rent or steal a fancy car in order to impress his girlfriend. If we have this trait in us, very few people will trust us to do any task well. It is easy to see through people who have dambha. So then, \u201cadambhitvam\u201d is utter absence of pretentiousness.        \u201cHimsaa\u201d means injury in a very broad sense of the word. There are five afflictions that are mentioned in the Yoga school of philosophy: ignorance, arrogance, desire, hatred and fear of death. Whenever we cause any of these afflictions or kleshas in any other person, we are injuring that person. When we do not cause any of these afflications, we demonstrate ahimsaa or non-injury. \u201cKshaantihi\u201d is an attitude of forgiveness that comes out of extreme titkshaa which is forbearance and tolerance. If we do not have this quality, we will get angry, flare up and lose our equanimity at every little jab or insult that anyone throws at us. In the second chapter Shri Krishna had emphasized the quality of forbearance as a means to achieve equanimity as well. The attitude of forgiveness developed through forbearance is similar to that of a mother who forgives any mistake committed by her child.         \u201cAarjavam\u201d refers to straightforwardness, an absence of crookedness in dealing with the world. It is derived from the root \u201criju\u201d which is the root of the word \u201cArjuna\u201d as well. This quality is reflected in us when our thoughts are aligned with our actions. Even children can see through someone who says one thing and does something else. \u201cAacharya\u201d refers to someone who collects the essence of the scriptures, like a honeybee collects nectar from flowers. Giving respect to such a learned master is called \u201caacharya upaasanam\u201d. By doing so, we acknowledge that we do not know everything, and that we are ready to follow the path laid out by the teacher, no matter how much it hurts our ego.         \u201cShaucham\u201d is purity of the body and the mind. The ritual of pooja is emphasized in Indian children because in that short period of time, we learn to maintain a high degree of external purity. If we reflect on this as we get older, that notion of external purity slowly seeps into our mind, and encourages us to develop purity in thought as well. \u201cSthairyam\u201d is the strength to remain firm in one\u2019s convictions, to remain steadfast in what we do. If we decide to meditate for ten minutes daily but cannot even do so for a couple of days, we will not be able to tackle much more challenging aspects of our material and spiritual journeys. \u201cAatmaa vinigraha\u201d is our ability to control our mind from its natural tendency to run after sense objects. The sense organs, which are under the control of the mind, have a natural tendency to go outwards. Through self control, we learn to turn them inward.         Shri Krishna covered nine qualities in tihs shloka. There are eleven more that are covered in the next few shlokas."

Now he explains how the individual comes into contact with the world. We saw in the last shloka that all of us come with a stock of unfulfilled desires or vaasanas that causes the individual to be born in this world. Shri Krishna says that the sprouting of desires or \u201cichchaa\u201d causes us to approach the world for fulfillment of those desires. If we obtain what we desire, we experience joy, and if we don\u2019t obtain it, we experience sorrow. If something repeatedly gives us sorrow, we develop a sense of hatred or \u201cdvesha\u201d towards it.         Desire, hatred, joy and sorrow are modifications or changes in the inner instrument, the antahakarana. The antahakarana always wants to create a sense of wholeness or completeness out of the diversity of limbs, hair, nerves, nails etc that make up one body. But it also wants to keep this collection of what it calls the body distinct from everything else in the world. This notion of completeness is called \u201csanghaata\u201d meaning assembly, and the will to preserve the assembly and keep it distinct from the world is called \u201cdhriti\u201d or fortitude. All biological desires arise from this desire to maintain the body as a distinct single entity.        Now we come to the modification of the antahakarana that gives it the quality of awareness and sentiency, known as \u201cchetanaa\u201d or awareness. Though we may be tempted to think that this sentiency in the antahakarana is the soul, the aatmaa, the eternal essence, it is not. It is a borrowed kind of awareness caused by a reflection of the eternal essence in the antahakarana, just like a pot filled with water reflects the sun in it. In fact, chetanaa and the six other modifications mentioned in this shloka are variously assumed to be the eternal essence by various schools of philosophy. Shri Krishna asserts that everything mentioned in this shloka and the prior shloka is not the eternal essence. It is kshetra, the field."

Similarly, when the universe comes into existence, its entire state is restored from avyaktam, the unmanifest \u201cfile\u201d containing the sum total of every unfulfilled desire. We then begin to see faint outlines of the universe, just like the computer first draws the outlines of the windows on the screen. This state is known as buddhi. We finally see the universe in full colour, in all its glory, just like we see a fully painted screen on our computer. This state is known as ahankara. This fully painted screen is created by combining three colours \u2013 red, blue and green \u2013 in various ways.         Similarly, the entire universe is created by combining the five great elements \u2013 space, air, fire, water and earth \u2013 in various ways. As humans, we are also comprised of those same five great elements. But, each of us looks and behaves differently than the other due to the difference in our \u201cprogramming\u201d \u2013 the avyakta, also known as vaasanaas or unfulfilled desires. Also, there is something within us that give us the ability to think, feel and act, which we do not see in inert objects. This is the inner instrument or the antahakarana. It is comprised of the buddhi or intellect which plans and decides, the ahankaara or ego which creates a sense of agency or I-ness and the mind which thinks and feels, referred in the shloka as \u201cekam\u201d or the one.         The mind receives stimuli from five sense organs \u2013 ears, skin, eyes, tongue and nose which run after their objects \u2013 sound, touch, form, taste and smell, respectively. The mind also controls five organs of action \u2013 mouth, hands, legs, genitals and bowels. The five elements, the five sense organs, their five corresponding sense objects, the five organs of actions, the mind, the intellect, the ego and the unmanifest \u2013 these make up the twenty four categories of the universe mentioned in the Saamkhya school of philosophy.        In just one shloka, Shri Krishna has explained the entire process of cosmic creation and its building blocks, as well as the specific factors that enable humans to think, feel and act. Plants and animals are also made up of similar building blocks, although not as fully expressed as in humans. Whenever we develop anxiety or frustration that this world is becoming too complex to understand, we can refer to this shloka and understand that at its core, the world is quite simple. Also, whenever we develop the mistaken notion that we are independent and do not need anything from this world, this shloka shows us our oneness with the world. Now this shloka only provides a static view of the world. How do we account for all the dynamism, the movement, the give and take between one human being and the rest of the world? This is explained in the next shloka."

He affirms that this very same knowledge was first revealed to the rishis or sages, and is not something that has been invented in the Gita. It was then documented in the four Vedas: the Rik, Saama, Yajur and Atharva. It is to be found in all three sections of each of these Vedas: the Samhitaa (hymns), Braahmanaa (theology) and Upanishads (discourses on divine knowledge). It is important to note that this knowledge was revealed to the sages in their meditations, and not authored as an original composition by anybody. Since this knowledge is beyond the realm of the senses and the mind, it could not have come from any one person\u2019s mind. It had to come from direct experience arrived at through meditation.        Now, even if we are able to access this divine knowledge by studying the Vedas, we cannot assimilate this knowledge without the help of logic. We need something that can explain, step-by-step, what is revealed in the four Vedas. We also need logic to reconcile apparent contradictions that we as students come across while studying the Vedas. The Brahma Sootras, authored by Vyaasa, use logic and reason to present the knowledge of the Vedas in a precise, formula-like method. Each sootra in that text is hardly two or three words long, but is packed with so much information that commentators like Shankaraachaarya write pages and pages to explain just one sootra.         The Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads and the Brahma Sootras are known as the \u201cPrasthaana Traya\u201d, and together provide a comprehensive compendium of knowledge about the field and its knower, as well as practical training on how to go about it. Of the three, the Bhagavad Gita is closest to the understanding of a common man. Shri Krishna instructs us to learn about the field and the knower in brief such that we can progress in our spiritual journey. But if we want to delve deeper into the details for academic reasons, we are more than welcome to read the Vedas and the Brahma Sootras. He now proceeds to talk about the field, the kshetra, in detail."

Shri Krishna said that there is only one kind of knowledge that has to be known by a seeker: that there are several bodies or conditionings called fields, and there is just one knower of the field that is as though limited by these bodies due to ignorance or avidyaa. Since there is a lot more to be said about this subject, Shri Krishna lists all the relevant topics that he has to cover.        With regards to the kshetra, the field, we have to learn about what it is, what are its characteristics, how does it undergo modifications and what it its source. With regards to the knower of the field, the kshetragnya, we have to also learn what it is, what are its powers and what are its effects. This is the theoretical aspect of this chapter. All this will be covered in just a few shlokas, or \u201cin brief\u201d from Shri Krishna\u2019s standpoint, but we will study it elaborately.        Another topic that will be covered in this chapter is the comparison between the individual and the world, how does the individual come in contact with the world, how does he transact with the world, and what are the means of knowledge he can use to maintain the awareness of the field and its knower throughout his life. This is an extremely practical and useful aspect of this chapter."

In this shloka, Shri Krishna uses these terms to indicate the identity or oneness of the kshetragnya in all kshetras. Let us try to understand this very important point. Like Arjuna did in the first chapter, most of us consider our self, our \u201cI\u201d, as this body, and therefore get stuck in the sorrows of this world. As we understand the message of the first six chapters, we understand that we are the eternal essence which is different than our body. We then understand from the next six chapters that Ishvara is the foundation of this world as the lower Prakriti or matter, and higher Prakriti or consciousness. Now, in this shloka, Shri Krishna says that there is no such distinction between the individual eternal essence and the foundation of this world. There is only one kshetragnya, and any notion of separation is illusory, caused by avidyaa or ignorance. This is the great statement, the mahaa vaakya \u201cTat Tvam Asi\u201d of the Vedas. You and Ishvara are the same in essence, there is no difference.        When we first hear someone say that we are the same as Ishvara, we don\u2019t find it quite logical. We say, how can a body that is five feet eight inches tall be the same as Ishvara who is large enough to contain all the planets and stars of the universe within him? To answer this, we have to first remember that \u201cTat Tvam Asi\u201d is not meant to be taken literally. Again, let us proceed step by step. First, let us understand the term \u201cupaadhi\u201d. It means something that limits or conditions a more general thing. A wave is an upaadhi of water. A light bulb is an upaadhi of electricity. An ornament is an upaadhi of gold. We can obtain the general thing that the upaadhi limits or hides by a process of mental removal. Mentally remove the wave, and you get water. Mentally remove the bulb, you get electricity. Mentally remove the ornament, you get gold. We can take this even further. Mentally remove the labels Mercedes Benz and Maruti 800 from the word car, and you get metal, rubber, petrol and plastic. Mentally remove the labels Indian and American from the word person, and you get flesh, bones and blood.        Now, having undersood what an upaadhi is, and how it can be mentally removed, let us proceed to understand what the word \u201cAsi\u201d in \u201cTat Tvam Asi\u201d indicates. It is not to be literally interpreted as Tvam (You) Asi (are equal to) Tat (Ishvara). Asi means \u201care equal to, when you remove the upaadhi\u201d. If we apply this meaning, the mahaa vaakya reads : Tvam (You) Asi (are equal to) Tat (Ishvara) when you remove both the upaadhis of You and Ishvara. I as a human have the upaadhi of the physical body and everything it contains. Ishvara has the upaadhi of the entire universe in its visible form including all the trees, plants, animals, people, stars, planets etc that we see with our senses. If we mentally remove our body as an upaadhi, and we also mentally remove the visible universe as an upaadhi, we are left with the same eternal essence in both cases. That same eternal essence, that same kshetragnya, is present in all kshetras, which are the same as upaadhis.         Another meaning of the word \u201cupaadhi\u201d is title or qualification, which can help us understand this shloka in a different way. Let\u2019s say there are two brothers in a house. One of them has a PhD in physics, and the other is a manager in a multinational. When each of them is in their respective offices, they use their titles as part of their job responsibilities. But when they perform a pooja or a holy ritual, lets say, they mentally remove their upaadhis or titles. If they did not remove their titles, their conversation would go like this: \u201cHey PhD in physics, do this. Hey manager, pour the clarified butter\u201d. They would never see that they are really the same family under the titles that seemingly create differences. This means that removing upaadhis to realize our oneness with Ishvara can be difficult, but it is not impossible. We know how to remove small upaadhis. Shri Krishna will teach us how to remove the biggest upaadhis in this chapter through practical techniques. He says that ultimately, knowledge of the kshetragnya, the kshetras or upaadhis, and how to realize oneness under the kshetras, is the ultimate knowledge that one has to learn, and not any other type of knowledge."

In the first six chapters, Shri Krishna focused on revealing the true nature of the individual self, what we refer to as \u201cI\u201d. In the first chapter, Arjuna was caught in a web of grief and delusion because he considered himself as a body that is attached to its friends and family. Shri Krishna revealed to Arjuna that his nature was the infinite eternal essence and not the body. He then guided Arjuna step by step through the means of arriving at this understanding starting with karma yoga, then karma sanyaasa yoga, and finally dhyaana yoga. Only in meditation can we experience the true nature of our \u201cI\u201d as the \u201csaakshi\u201d or witness of our body, mind and intellect.         In the next set of six chapters, Shri Krishna focused on revealing the true nature of the world we live in. We usually think of the world as comprised of matter in various forms. Shri Krishna revealed to Arjuna that this world is comprised not only of matter, but also of spirit or life-giving consciousness. These are also known as the lower and higher aspects of Prakriti or nature, respectively. He then revealed that Prakriti is nothing but a shakti or power of Ishvara himself, and therefore Ishvara is in all, and all is in Ishvara. He is the material cause or the raw matter, as well as the efficient cause or the intelligence that has created the universe. The true nature of the world is Ishvara who is the \u201cadhishthaana\u201d, the foundation or the substratum of the world.         Having revealed all of this, why do we need six more chapters? Let us proceed step by step, since we will be delving into new waters. Our antahakarana or inner instrument comprising the mind, intellect, ego and memory comes with three inbuilt defects. \u201cMala\u201d or dirt comprises our stock of unfulfilled desires. \u201cVikshepa\u201d is the tendency of the mind to jump from one thought to another. \u201cAavarana\u201d is the veiling or covering that hides the understanding of the true nature of the self, of who we are in essence. Karma yoga helps remove the defect of mala by extinguising selfish desires to a great extent. Bhakti yoga helps remove the defect of vikshepa through single-pointed devotion of Ishvara. However, we will never achieve complete self realization unless we tackle the third defect of Aavarana. That is the purpose of the last six chapters of the Gita.         How do the last six chapters remove this defect of aavarana or veiling? This can happen only when we intuitively understand the true meaning of the \u201cmahaa vaakyas\u201d or great statements that have been revealed in the Vedas. The Gita reveals the mahaa vaakya \u201cTat Tvam Asi\u201d which means \u201cYou Are That\u201d. The first six chapters of the Gita revealed the nature of \u201cTvam\u201d which means \u201cYou\u201d as the saakshi or witness, and the next six chapters revealed the true nature of \u201cTat\u201d which means \u201cThat\u201d as Ishvara, the adhishthaana or foundation. The last six chapters reveal \u201cAsi\u201d, the identity or the equality between the real nature of \u201cYou\u201d and \u201cThat\u201d. Shri Krishna knows that this topic may be somewhat tough to understand, so he addresses Arjuna as \u201cKaunteya\u201d, one whose intellect is as sharp as a knife or \u201ckunta\u201d, so that he remains sharp and alert throughout this chapter.        Now, let us look at the first shloka. The term \u201cshareera\u201d or body is used in a general sense to refer to the three bodies that we are made up of: the physical body, the subtle body (the mind, intellect, ego, memory and the physiological functions) and the causal body (our vaasanaas or unfulfilled desires). In other words, anything that is temporary, changing and  perishable is referred to as \u201cthis body\u201d. Shri Krishna says that anything that we term as \u201cthis body\u201d is defined as the \u201ckshetra\u201d, the field. But there is something in us which is changeless and knows that it is different from the ever-changing field. This intelligence principle in us, this consciousness is termed as the \u201ckshetragnya\u201d, the knower of the field. Both these terms are defined by the knowers of both the field and its knower, in other words, great seers and sages.         Why do we need to know such esoteric terms? Shri Krishna uses these terms to lay the groundwork for the next shloka, which is one of the most important shlokas in the Gita. He wants to give a foundation that we can use a spring board to leap into the next shloka."

        "content": "Shri Krishna ended the previous chapter with the message that Ishvara is in everything, and everything is in Ishvara. But since our senses see the world and not Ishvara, we need a way to constantly be aware of Ishvara\u2019s presence. Till we get to a state where this happens effortlessly, Shri Krishna asks us to take up the path of bhakti or devotion, where we constantly abide in the faith that Ishvara is in everything, and everything is in Ishvara. The seed of bhakti yoga was planted at the end of the previous chapter and is expounded in this chapter.        Arjuna began this chapter by asking the question: of the devotees who worship Ishvara with form, and of those who worship him without form, who is superior? Shri Krishna replied that the worshipper of Ishvara without form sees no difference between him and Ishvara. But for most of us who still have a little saatvik ahamkaara, which is the sense of distance or separation between us and Ishvara, worship of the formless Ishvara is quite difficult. Therefore, he recommends worship of Ishvara with form for the majority of devotees. The key qualification, however, is that of single pointed devotion.        Next, Shri Krishna gives us a sequence of steps to get to Ishvara, but takes into account where we are as ordinary devotees. We are instructed to begin with karma yoga where we renounce the fruits of action by submitting them to Ishvara. We then begin performing every action for the sake of Ishvara, which is bhakti yoga, the yoga of devotion. Once we have diminished our selfish desires and our ego to a large extent, we are urged to take up raaja yoga where we repeatedly meditate upon Ishvara with form. Finally, we reach a stage where we remain in constant awareness and knowledge of our oneness with Ishavara, which is jnyaana yoga, the yoga of knowledge.         The chapter ends with a list of thirty nine qualities of a perfected devotee. They are meant to inspire us. Even if we cannot gain all these qualities, we should aim for acquiring at least one, because gaining even one quality opens the door to the acquiring the rest. In all of these qualities, equanimity, unselfishness, lack of attachment and unwavering faith towards Ishvara are repeatedly emphasized."

In this shloka, he concludes this topic by highlighting two key attributes of such devotees: shraddha or faith, and making Ishvara as their ultimate goal, \u201cmatparamaahaa\u201d. He terms the teaching of this chapter as the nectar of dharma. We can interpret the word dharma to mean the universal law of nature from the ninth chapter, or also as the nine fold bhaagvat dharma of Prahlaada that was explained earlier in this chapter.        Why are faith and goal-setting given such importance in bhakti or the path of devotion? Consider a child who eventually wants to study at one of the top universities in the world. Until he reaches a stage where he can qualify to attend that university, get selected for admission and begin his coursework, he needs to have faith in the notion that graduating from that university will significantly improve his life. That faith will propel him to set the single-pointed goal of academic success, work hard, to keep aside all distractions and to not give up. Only when he actually graduates will he not need faith anymore, because he has achieved what he set out to achieve. But until them, it is only faith in the goal that keeps him going.        Therefore, Shri Krishna says that those devotees who have fixed Ishvara as the goal, and that who have unwavering faith in that goal, are extremely dear to him. Devotees who love Ishvara without having known him first are devotees of the highest caliber, since it is more difficult to love something without having first known it. Such devotees, who do not need to become monks but just diligently worship Ishvara with form, are assured of liberation by Ishvara himself. This is the concluding message of the twelfth chapter.        om tatsatiti shreematbhagavatgitasupanishadsu brahmavidyaayaam yogashaastre shreekrishnaarjunsamvade bhaktiyogo naama dvaadashodhyaayaha || 12 ||"

He first says that both praise and insult have no effect on the devotee. Praise and insult are usually targeted towards a person\u2019s name. But the devotee, having given up all identification with his name, does not care whether he is praised or insulted, just like the sky does not get affected whether someone throws roses at it or dirt. The devotee is also a mauni, one who remains silent. Here, the silence does not refer to verbal silence but to silence of desires and thoughts that are devoid of Ishvara as their basis.        The ocean is not affected whether it gets a torrential downpour or no rain at all. It happily accepts whatever comes its way because it is content with itself. Similarly, the devotee is content in his constant devotion to Ishvara, and therefore accepts whatever comes his way without any complaint. The devotee also does not have an attitude of possession towards anything, including his home. Like the wind that comes and goes anywhere as it pleases, the devotee considers the entire world his home and is attached his house, his physical body, his mind, his intellect or his desires.        As we proceed along the path of devotion, we will notice that our mind shifts between giving reality to the world as part of Ishvara, and giving reality to the world as separate from Ishvara. As long as we give reality to the world as an independent entity, we can never get rid of our unfulfilled desires, and the attachment to the world that results from those desires. A perfected devotee is one whose mind is fixed on giving reality to the world as a part of Ishvara, giving up all selfish desires in the process. Shri Krishna says that a person who harbours all these attributes is fit to be called a naraha, a human being, in the true sense of the world. Such a devoted person is very dear to him."

By using the word \u201csamaha\u201d twice, he emphasizes equanimity and stability of the devotee\u2019s antahakarana or inner instrument that is made possible through intense devotion to Ishvara. Right from the second chapter, we have repeatedly heard about the importance of bringing equanimity to the inner instrument, which is made up of our intellect, our mind and senses, our ego and our memory. Just like an astronomer can see extremely faint light from stars that are millions of miles away using his telescope, we can experience the eternal essence only if our inner instrument is free of desires and agitations caused by the reactions mentioned in this and the next shloka.        Our inner equipment contacts the world through the sense organs. The skin, for example, experiences heat and cold. This reporting of hotness or coolness is akin to a thermometer in that it is extremely objective and factual. When this sensation travels to the mind, however, it can be interpreted either as joy or sorrow based on inputs from other sense organs and from the memory. If the skin sends a message of hotness, the mind feels joy in winter and sorrow in summer. Similarly, sounds are picked up by the ear, sent to the mind which compares them against its memory to generate words. If the words enhance the ego, the \u201cdoer\u201d notion in the intellect, registers a sense of honour. If the words bring down the ego, the intellect registers dishonour.        What causes the intellect and the mind to attach all these positive and negative reactions to simple messages that come from the skin and the ears and so on? It is the degree of attachment or identification of the ego. If the ego is heavily attached to the body, for example, then any comment about the body will generate a strong positive or negative reaction in the mind, disturbing its sense of equanimity in the process.        But one who has removed his attachment from the body/mind/intellect and attached himself to the service of Ishvara does not generate strong positive or negative reactions. He considers his body as a part of Ishvara\u2019s creation, therefore there is very little sense of egoism when it comes to the body, mind or intellect. When someone criticizes a devotee\u2019s body, it is like someone is criticizing a random object that the devotee has no connection with, and hence, no strong positive or negative reaction is generated.         The message of this shloka concludes in the following shloka."

He now elaborates upon the attitude of a perfected devotee towards situations, objects, thoughts and emotions that he encounters. These may come to him either as a result of his actions or as a matter of course in his daily life.        When we usually encounter a situation or obtain an object, we are either attracted to it, repulsed by it or are indifferent to it. Attraction generates desires that are stored in our mind, and repulsion generates negative desires, a list of things we would like to stay away from. If we eventually get the favourable object, or hold on to the favourable situation long enough, we become \u201charshita\u201d, we rejoice. But if we lose that object or situation, which is bound to happen sometime, we become \u201cshochita\u201d, we grieve. Attraction, revulsion, desire, hatred, joy, grief \u2013 this is how most of us usually operate.        The perfected devotee, however, has tackled this problem at its root. He has stopped labelling any object, person, situation or thought as either good or bad, because it is exactly this labelling that starts the chain reaction of attraction, desire, joy and sorrow. He is like the model student who does not label his teacher\u2019s feedback as good or bad, whether it be praise or criticism, because he has the utmost faith in his teacher. The perfected devotee accepts all objects and situations as Ishvara\u2019s blessings, does what he has to do, and moves on. Shri Krishna says that one who accepts whatever comes with way due to his faith and devotion to Ishvara, is dear to him."

Now, he explains the perfected devotee\u2019s attitude towards action. It is not a surprise to us that the perfected devotee is also a perfected karma yogi. He has understood the art of  performing any action, big or small, in line with Shri Krishna\u2019s teaching on karma yoga, thereby achieving perfection in action.         To begin with, the perfected karma yogi is shuchihi or pure. His mind has been purged of selfish desires, leaving room only for actions pertaining to his duties or svadharma. If the action is not part of his svadharma, he doesn\u2019t undertake new initiatives unnecessarily. Also, he dedicates the results of his actions to Ishvara. This enables him to give up apekshaa or expectations about the result, as well as concern about what happened in the past. He is udaaseenaha, unconcerned and unattached, not because he does not care about the action, but because he doesn\u2019t get attached to the result of the action.        With no mental agitations caused by future expectations or past anxiety, the karma yogi performs actions with great dexterity and fearlessness. \u201cYogaha karmasu kaushalam\u201d \u2013 dexterity in action is karma yoga as we saw in the second chapter. The karma yogi devotes all his attention and brings great focus to the task at hand, keeping all distractions aside. He also performs the work as an emissary of Ishvara, which removes any notion of fear, hesitation or doubt from his mind. Shri Krishna says that this type of devotee, the perfected karma yogi, is very dear to him."

It is seen by some as a great honour to be roasted, as the individual is surrounded by friends, fans, and well-wishers, who can receive some of the same treatment as well during the course of the evening. The party and presentation itself are both referred to as a roast.         In our life, when we are dealing with other people, it is inevitable that we will experience a whole host of emotional reactions to what those people say to us. Four common reactions are excitement on hearing something pleasant, irritation on hearing something unpleasant, fear on hearing something worrisome, and agitation when meeting someone that has the upper hand in the conversation. But in a \u201croast\u201d, the individual happily accepts all sorts of abuses and insults, because he knows that they are coming from his friends and well-wishers, people that he knows as his own, not separate from him. At the end of the roast, the individual in turn insults and abuses the people that insulted him earlier, and no one feels any ill-will towards him for the same reasons.        Similarly, the devotee who considers everyone and everything as the play of Ishvara, including himself, has no reason to take anything personally. His sense of self is not the small ego that most of us consider as our \u201cI\u201d. He has identified with Ishvara who runs multitudes of universes. Any sort of insult, agitation or fear dissipates instantly because he views the insult, the insulter and the recipient of the insult as Ishvara. He thinks of it as a play where his friends are the actors and directors. Shri Krishna says that such a person who is free from agitations, and who does not agitate any one else, is dear to him."

Contentment is a state where the mind does not want anything else from the world. But, this state is temporary because the contentment has been triggered by something that is temporary and finite, like food for example. Shri Krishna says that the yogi, the perfected devotee, derives contentment from Ishvara within himself, therefore he does not need to become a bhogi, one who runs after material objects for contentment. He is \u201csatatam santushta\u201d, even contented.        Another quality of a perfected devotee is a firm conviction that only Ishvara exists, and that the world does not exist independently of Ishvara. Most of us assume that the world has an independent existence. We attach all sorts of values to it. causing our intellect to generate innumerable goals and convictions around those values. The perfected devotee sees only Ishvara everywhere, and therefore is ever steadfast in his conviction that only Ishvara exists.         This \u201cdridha nishchaya\u201d or firm conviction is demonstrated by the devotee\u2019s submission of mind and intellect in Ishvara, and also, the control of the mind, body and senses. When the intellect is convinced that only Ishvara exists, and when the mind thinks only of Ishvara, the devotee does not need any other special yogic technique to control the organs of action and the sense organs. Selfish desires are the cause of the mind, body and senses deviating from prescribed actions. When there is only the desire for Ishvara, they can never deviate. Shri Krishna says that the perfected devotee is a \u201csatatam yataatmaa\u201d, one who has complete self control at all times.         Here Shri Krishna concludes the line of thought that he began in the previous shloka by asserting that the devotee who has inculcated these traits is very dear to Ishvara. These eight shlokas starting from the thirteenth shloka are one of the most famous and beloved shlokas in the Gita."

In the second chapter, he devoted several shlokas to describe the traits towards aspects of one who is established in the eternal essence. Here, he describes the traits of saints and accomplished devotees towards other people, which are easier for us to connect with, and become goals for people like us to strive towards.        An accomplished devotee essentially is convinced of two things: that everything in this world is not different than Ishvara, and that the devotee himself is also not different from Ishvara. When he has this outlook, he loses all sense of \u201cI-ness\u201d and \u201cmine-ness\u201d. He never believes that he exists outside of the existence of Ishvara. There is no sense of \u201cI\u201d-ness because only one \u201cI\u201d \u2013 Ishvara \u2013 exists. There is no sense of possession because everything belongs to Ishvara. It is somewhat similar to the outlook one has towards a large family.        So when there is such a universal sense of oneness with everything, the devotee becomes extremely friendly towards everyone. There is no sense of dislike or hatred present in him towards those who oppose him. Instead, he instantly forgives everyone. He is compassionate towards those who are in need. When all sense of duality is gone, the mind does not get agitated in sorrowful situations, nor does it get excited in joyful situations. It maintains a sense of equanimity.         This partial shloka continues next."

They were laid out in descending order, addressing the most qualified to the least qualified. Jnyaana yoga was prescribed for those who have given up attachment to the body, abhyaasa yoga for those who can sit for meditation, bhakti yoga for those who can perform every action for Ishvara, and karma yoga for those who can dedicate the results of their actions to Ishvara.        Here, Shri Krishna provides a recap of those four shlokas as well as providing some additional insights into the nuances of each stage. He first says that knowledge is superior to practice. Here, practice refers to mere mechanical chanting of japas without the involvement of the mind or the intellect. Such inert practice will not lead us anywhere. Shri Krishna cautions us against jumping into meditative practice without the knowledge of what we are doing, how to do it, what is the goal and so on.        Next, he says that meditation is superior to knowledge. Here, the word meditation is used in the sense of a higher kind of knowledge, one that does not create a distinction between the knower and the known, one that is a direct, intuitive understanding of Ishvara. This higher kind of knowledge is superior than dry, academic knowledge gained through a cursory reading of the scriptures without the guidance of a guru, and without the perfect internalization of that knowledge through a pure mind and intellect. In this sense, meditation or higher knowledge is superior to purely academic knowledge.        Now to get to these two stages, we have to take stock of our qualifications. Shri Krishna knew that the majority of people would have a great sense of attachment to the body, as well as a large stock of selfish desires that prompt them to selfish actions. They need a technique that is appropriate for their qualifications, and that will bring them to a stage where they can eventually practice meditation. For such individuals, renunciation of the fruits of actions, or karma yoga, is superior than meditation. Only renunciation will bring short term peace through reduction of worry for the future, and long term peace by making us qualified for meditation."

We know from basic physics that every action must result in a reaction, it must give a result. This result can be material (money), emotional (joy) or intellectual (satisfaction). By calling it a fruit, Shri Krishna reminds us that every result contains the seed of a future action hidden within it. This seed can give rise to innumerable actions, which can give rise to innumerable seeds, and so on and so forth.         How does that seed germinate into an action? If we eat a delicacy for the first time, our tastebuds send a signal to our ego which says \u201cthis delicacy is tasty\u201d. The ego then says \u201cI like this delicacy, it makes me happy, therefore I shall have it again\u201d. The delicacy contained the seed of desire, but the ego made the delicacy into a source of happiness, paving the way for future actions towards acquiring that delicacy.        This is the condition of a majority of seekers. We are so tied up in the material world that we find it difficult to go beyond the satisfaction of our ego. We cannot bring bhakti or devotion into our lives like Shri Krishna prescribed in the previous shloka. Our primary desires are material, not spiritual. For seekers in this condition, Shri Krishna gives two simple suggestions: submit the results of actions to him, and control the senses as much as possible.         So if we eat a delicacy for the first time, our taste buds will definitely say that it is tasty. But instead of letting the ego say \u201cthis delicacy is tasty\u201d, we can say \u201cI submit this lovely taste to Ishvara, may he enjoy it\u201d. The ego does not get a chance to assert itself, and in this manner the seed of future action is destroyed on the spot. Conversely, if we are studying for an exam and are worried about the result, we can say \u201cI submit the result of this exam to Ishvara, good or bad\u201d. This will eliminate constant worrying and the consequent stress caused by it, leaving our mind free to study efficiently.         Shri Krishna also asks us to control our mind and our senses. Both our mind and our senses have a natural affinity for sense objects. If we leave them unchecked, they will start brooding over sense objects and develop an attachment towards them. The second chapter had explained how this happens in great detail. So therefore, checking our senses and our mind will reduce the inflow of selfish desires to a great extent, and submission of results to Ishvara will transfer our enjoyership from our ego to Ishvara. This is karma yoga, the most simple and basic spiritual technique that takes us one step closer to Ishvara."

Our stock of desires prevents us from pursuing even a few hours of daily meditation. We cannot sit still in one place. If we do so, we get distracted every so often. And even if we are able meditate, we still need to remain attuned to Ishvara for the majority of the day when we are not meditating. How do we achieve this? It is through the yoga of devotion, bhakti yoga.        Prahlaada, son of the king of demons and one of the greatest devotees of Lord Vishnu, was asked by his father Hiranyakashipu about what he had learned in school. He replied that one should serve Ishvara by making every act into an act of worship. Shravana refers to the constant listening of Ishvara\u2019s glories; kirtanam is the singing the names of Ishvara; smaranam refers to constant remembering of Ishvara; paadasevanam is adoring Ishvara\u2019s feet; archanam is worshipping Ishvara in temples or in our own homes; vandanam is the offering prayers; daasyam is to consider ourselves as servants of Ishvara; sakhyam: considering ourselves as friends of Ishvara; and finally, aatmanivedana where we completely offer ourselves to Ishvara.        What happens when we lead our life this way? When every action including our work in the office, our chores at home, our studies in school and our dealings with friends and family becomes an act of worship, we slowly erode our sense of doership or agentship. Instead of acting with the notion \u201cI am doing this\u201d, we begin to act with the notion \u201cIshvara is doing everything\u201d. We submit our ego into the altar of Ishvara. As our sense of ego dissolves, we become qualified to practice abhyaasa yoga, and ultimately, jnyaana yoga. So therefore, incorporating Ishvara into eevry aspect of our lives is bhakti yoga."

While watching a concert, we may admire how easily he can handle complex passages on the piano, but we know that the prowess is a result of years, maybe even decades, of repeated practice. In his book \u201cOutliers\u201d, author Malcolm Gladwell emphasizes the \u201c10,000 hour rule\u201d. The key to success in any field is a matter of practising a task for 10,000 hours. Here, Shri Krishna says that if we are unable to constantly fix our mind in Ishvara, we should set aside some time daily and practice doing so.        In the sixth chapter, Arjuna admits to Shri Krishna that it is very difficult for someone to keep their mind in Ishvara all the time, and asks for a solution to this problem. There as well, Shri Krishna recommends the technique of \u201cabhyaasa\u201d or repeated practice. In this technique, we first choose an object of worship such as the image of a deity, a spiritual text or a mantra. Then, following the instructions in the sixth chapter, we set aside a fixed time and place every day to meditate upon the object of worship. Whenever our thoughts stray away, we gently bring them back so that we are only thinking about the object of worship. This yoga is known as raaja yoga, ashtaanga yoga or dhyaana yoga.        Note that abhyaasa is not possible without its counterpart vairaagya or dispassion towards the material world. Without reducing our stock of material desires, it is virtually impossible to sit in meditation. Each vaasanaa, each unfulfilled desire has the potential to produce a series of thoughts in our mind. When we sit for meditation, these unfulfilled desires start competing with each other to produce thoughts that distract us from the object of worship. Therefore, Shri Krishna advises us to follow abhyaasa and vairaagya together.        Now, with the practice of dhyaana yoga, we only think of Ishvara for a brief period of time each day. How should we continue our spiritual practice throughout the rest of the day? Or, our stock of desires may not even let us sit in one place. Then how should we worship Ishvara? Shri Krishna addresses this next."

This shloka describes the path of jnyaana yoga or the yoga of knowledge. Shri Krishna says that the seeker should fix both his intellect and mind in Ishvara constantly, without any interruption. When this happens, that attainment of Ishvara is guaranteed. There is no room for \u201csanshaya\u201d or doubt of attaining Ishvara when one practices jnyaana yoga. But doing so is not easy.        As a new year approaches, many of us start making new year resolutions such as losing weight, giving up a bad habit, cleaning the house and so on. It is our buddhi or intellect that sets firm long-term goals, targets and resolutions. Ultimately all types of plans and resolutions stem from our desires to achieve something in this world. Now, Jnyaana yoga requires us to have just one resolution and nothing else: to merge with Ishvara. But as we have seen in the second chapter, our stock of desires influences our intellect to make innumerable resolutions. This multitude of resolutions makes jnyaana yoga difficult.        Furthermore, our condition is such that it is not just the intellect that has many resolutions. The mana, our faculty of mind, is fickle to begin with due to the distractions of the senses. Jnyaana yoga requires the fixing of both the intellect and the mind onto Ishvara. It is in rare instances that we can achieve intellectual and mental harmony, such as studying for an exam, where we know that the stakes are high. But even that happens for a few minutes or a few hours at most.        So clearly, jnyaaya yoga, the foremost type of yoga, is difficult for most of us, atleast at our current stage of spiritual evolution. Is there something easier? Shri Krishna answers next."

Garuda promised to bring the nectar of immortality from heaven and give it to the serpents in exchange for his mother\u2019s freedom. Once the nectar was delivered, Lord Indra took it back to heaven, but spilt a few drops on a kind of grass known as dharba. The serpents tried to lick the nectar on the grass, but spilt their tongue doing so. As a result, all serpents have forked tongues even to this day.        Let us now look into the symbolic meaning of this story from the Puraanaas. The world comprises of objects that are a two things at once: naamaroopa (name and form) and Ishvara. The Ishvara in us wants to contact the Ishvara in those objects, but we make the mistake of letting our senses rush after the name and form aspects of the objects. We are like the serpents that really want nectar, but chase the dharba grass and cut ourselves in the process. Chasing of objects in the belief that they will give us joy, and receiving sorrow instead of joy, this is samsaara. Repeatedly chasing objects ensures that the cycle of birth and death continues.          In the Indian tradition, samsaara is referred to as an ocean in which most people are stuck until their death, only to be reborn again. Shri Krishna says that those devotees who worship Ishvara with form and meet the qualifications listed in the previous shloka are saved from samsaara by Ishvara himself. Unlike most material endeavours that take a long time, this process is \u201cnachiraat\u201d or swift. The key condition is that we have to think of Ishvara as the ultimate goal and nothing else. This is \u201csaguna upasaana\u201d, worship of Ishvara with form, in a nutshell.        Now, Shri Krishna enumerates the types of yogas or practices through which we can attain Ishvara."

We used the example of a child helping his parents to understand the attitude of the formless worshipper and the example of the worker helping his CEO exemplifying the worshipper of Ishvara with form. Now Shri Krishna re-emphasizes the qualifications of the worshipper of Ishvara with form, which is the route that most of us will take.        First, we have to renounce all our actions to Ishvara, in other words, practice karma yoga. Typically, when we perform any actions, we are looking for a tangible material result (monetary profit), emotional result (happiness) or an intellectual result (satisfaction). If our actions don\u2019t turn out as we anticipated, we may get opposite results in the form of loss, sorrow or dissatisfaction. When we perform actions for the sake of renunciation to Ishvara, we leave the outcome to Ishvara, whether it is favourable or not.        When we do this, our mind and intellect do not constantly get destabilized by life\u2019s ups and downs, leaving them free to contemplate the higher goal of Ishvara. But this can only happen through the practice of single-pointed worship, \u201cananya yoga\u201d, the yoga where there is no other goal but Ishvara. In this manner, when we constantly worship Ishvara through our body, mind and intellect, he takes care of us. How does he do that? Shri Krishna completes this thought in the next shloka."

We would also be on the lookout for others who are trying to impress him, and perhaps try to be one step ahead of them.        Although we look different than our parents, we feel no sense of difference from them. However, we see a difference between the title of the CEO and our title which could be software engineer, manager and so on. Similarly, Shri Krishna says that the one who is \u201cdeha vad\u201d or embodied, the one who still has attachment to the notion that \u201cI am Mr. so and so with a 5 feet 7 inch body, working for XYZ corporation\u201d, such a person will always have a tinge of separation from Ishvara.        So for the majority of us who want to become devotees, it is \u201cadhikatara klesha\u201d, quite difficult to worship Ishvara in his formless aspect. Our sense of attachment to the body creates a sort of wall, a kind of separation between the devotee and Ishvara. We are carrying conditionings of several lifetimes, perhaps, that prevent us from accessing Ishvara in his formless aspect. Extreme vairagya or detachment is required for this.

In this and the next shloka, he described the seeker who worships the \u201cnirguna\u201d, the formless Ishvara. Shri Krishna wants to clearly differentiate the formless from the formful, so he provides a list of adjectives to describe the formless Ishvara, to the extent that it is possible to do so.        \u201cAksharam\u201d refers to that which does not decay, that which is imperishable. The seeker negates everything that he encounters as perishable, so only the subject remains. \u201cAnirdeshyam\u201d is that which cannot be described or defined by the speech and mind. \u201cAvyaktam\u201d refers to anything that is not accessible to our senses, something that is invisible.  \u201cSarvatragam\u201d is that which is not limited by space, that which pervades everywhere and everything. \u201cAchintyam\u201d is that which cannot be conceived as a thought by the mind.        Anything that is filled with fault is called \u201ckoota\u201d. So that by which the defect-ridden maaya and its activities look real is called \u201ckootastha\u201d, the foundation or base on which maaya appears. \u201cKootastha\u201d also means anvil which denotes changelessness in time. \u201cAchalam\u201d refers to fixity, changelessness in space. \u201cDhruvam\u201d is that which is eternal and deathless. In this manner, a seeker worships the formless Ishvara.         Let us also understand what is meant by \u201cupasaanaa\u201d or meditative worship, since that is the theme of this chapter. Shankaracharya gives a long definition in his commentary. Upaasanaa literally means to sit near. Here it refers to the seeker taking on the quality of the object of worship by moving his mind as near to that object as he can. The object of worship should be selected with the advice of the guru and scriptures. It should not be arbitrary. Then the seeker should continuously think about the object, just like an unbroken stream of oil poured from a height.         Shri Krishna continues the description of nirguna upaasakaas, seekers of the formless Ishvara, in the next shloka."

Shri Krishna begins by describing those devotees who worship Ishvara endowed with form. He says that such devotees are the most superior yogis because they are constantly engaged in worship of Ishvara, full of supreme faith.        Three qualities of a superior yoga are highlighted here. Firstly, we as devotees should be able to fix our mind on Ishvara, using all the instruction given in chapter six and other places as well. In the initial stages of meditation, keeping our mind on Ishvara even for ten minutes is quite an achievement. Secondly, we have to be \u201cnitya yuktaa\u201d, the ability to remain constantly engaged in worship, without letting the mind divert itself to other pursuits. Thirdly, we need to be endowed with supreme and unwavering faith.           Even though these qualities may seem easy to attain on the surface, they are not so. Shri Krishna chooses words that indicate that he is looking for the highest kind of concentration and faith. For example, he uses the word \u201caaveshya\u201d to describe concentration, but what it really means is using our thoughts to enter, to penetrate into the object of concentration. This kind of concentration requires a highly purified mind, free from selfish likes and dislikes and from attachment to material concerns. Our degree of faith further reinforces the ability to remain focused on our object of concentration.         So then, what is Shri Krishna\u2019s opinion on those devotees who worship Ishvara as the unmanifest? This comes next."

Chapters two to five explained what is the true nature of the individual, and using karma yoga to purify oneself. Chapter six explained how to remain constantly in one\u2019s true nature through the yoga of meditation. Chapters seven to ten gave us an elaborate description of Ishvara, culminating with the vision of the cosmic form in the eleventh chapter.        The theme of this chapter is bhakti yoga, the yoga of devotion to Ishvara. Throughout the Gita, Shri Krishna has said, \u201cperform actions for me\u201d, \u201cbecome devoted to me\u201d, \u201cmake me your supreme goal\u201d. But we have to first know, who is this \u201cme\u201d that is to be worshipped? There are some places in the Gita where Shri Krishna has described himself as imperishable, unmanifest, not visible to our senses. Conversely, he has shown his visible cosmic form to Arjuna in the previous chapter. In India, most devotees worship images of their chosen deities in their homes and temples.        So then, Arjuna wants to know, who is the superior devotee? Is it the one who worships the unmanifest, or is it one who worships the manifest? There is a well-known Marathi bhajan (devotional song) that asks the very same question : do I call you saguna or nirguna? Saguna means one with attributes, one that can be seen and felt. Nirguna means one that has no attributes. It is a tough choice for Shri Krishna. He answers the question in the next shloka."

        "content": "All of us know that even the largest tree came from a tiny seed. But our eyes cannot see the miniscule changes that transform the seed into a sapling, then into a plant and so on. Only when we take a series of photographs each day and play them at high speed can we actually see the seed turn into a tree. Our other senses have similar limitations. The mind, which gives meaning to the information from our senses, chops up time and space. It can never view the unity of things.        Arjuna was aware of this limitation. Having heard about Ishvara\u2019s vibhootis or grand expressions in the prior chapter, he desperately wanted to get rid of this limitation. In response to his request, Shri Krishna granted him divine vision that enabled him to see the universe without the limitations of space and time. Without the limitation of time, Arjuna did not just see the tree, he saw the seed, the sapling and the tree all at once. Without the limitation of space, he saw not just that tree, but all the trees in the universe all at once.        Our mind has another limitation. It tends to get attracted to some things, and gets repelled from other things. To highlight this limitation, Shri Krishna first showed Ishvara\u2019s pleasant form, and then followed it with his frightful, menacing form. Everything that existed in the pleasant form was violently destroyed by the same Ishvara. Shri Krishna later emphasized that creation and destruction were to be viewed in the same light, because creation cannot happen without destruction. Both have their place in the universe. Also, when one\u2019s actions or karmas are exhausted on earth, they are destroyed. There is no randomness or personal bias in who gets destroyed.        Shri Krishna concluded this chapter by instructing Arjuna on how to attain Ishvara. The key qualification is ananya bhakti, or single-pointed devotion. Combined with karma yoga, jnyana yoga, subduing likes and dislikes and giving up attachment to the material world, we are able to access Ishvara in his cosmic form. The previous shloka enabled us to see the one Ishvara in everything, the one in all. This chapter urges us to see the all in one."

It is this concluding shloka of the eleventh chapter which Shankaraachaarya considers the essence of the entire Bhagavad Gita. Shri Krishna says that Isvara can be attained by following five guidelines : perform actions for the sake of Ishvara, fix Ishvara as the ultimate goal, observe single-pointed devotion to Ishvara, remain free from worldly attachments, do not harbour likes or dislikes.        We have come across these themes throughout the Gita, but this is the first time that Shri Krishna reveals how they come together as a logical whole. First, he advises us to follow karma yoga, to perform selfless actions by dedicating them to Ishvara. He then advises us to fix Ishvara as the ultimate goal. This is the yoga of knowledge or jnyaana yoga. But we need something that propels us from karma yoga to jnyaana yoga. That is revealed as the third step, the yoga of devotion or bhakti yoga. None of these steps can be accomplished with a mind filled with the impurities of likes and dislikes that generate material attachment. These are addressed in fourth and fifth steps which are freedom from worldly attachments as well as from likes and dislikes.        Furthermore, all five steps are interconnected and strengthen each other. The mind cannot fully detach itself from everything. Like a child that drops attachment to toys and is attached to higher ideals as an adult, Shri Krishna advises us to drop attachments to material things and develop attachment for Ishvara. When we begin to see everything as Ishvara, and see ourselves as part of Ishvara, we will not generate feelings of dislike towards anyone or anything, just like we do not have enmity towards any part of our own body. This is the theme of this chapter, where the individual essence sees itself as part of the universal eternal essence.        om tatsatiti shreematbhagavatgitasupanishadsu brahmavidyaayaam yogashaastre shreekrishnaarjunsamvade vishwaroopadarshanayogo naama ekadashodhyaayaha || 11 ||"

It cannot be through any action such as rituals, study of the Vedas and so on since all of these methods are in the realm of space and time. \u201cAnanya bhakti\u201d, or single-pointed devotion is the only means to access Ishvara. We have come across the term \u201cananya\u201d in prior chapters. It means that in which there is no \u201canya\u201d, no other. We should not be devoted to Ishvara so that we can get something else. The devotion should be for obtaining Ishvara and nothing else.         We see this principle in our daily life as well. You have two friends, one who always comes to you when he needs something from you, not otherwise. Another friend comes to you just to know how you are doing, without any ulterior motive or hidden agenda. We would always prefer to deal with the second friend, and say to him \u201cmy house is your house, don\u2019t behave like a stranger, take what you want\u201d. Similarly, when we ask something materialistic from Ishvara, we treat him as different from us. Ishvara does not like this. When we want only Ishvara, we do not treat him as different from us. This is the crux of single-pointed devotion.        In the second half of the shloka, Shri Krishna outlines the process of attaining Ishvara. First, we have to know what Ishvara is, discarding all our prior notions. We have to know him as \u201ctattvena\u201d, in his essence, as pervading the entire world, not as someone hiding up in the sky somewhere. When we gain this knowledge and reflect upon it constantly, we begin to see Ishvara in everything, and everything as Ishvara. But the last step, of not seeing Ishvara from the outside, but of totally merging into Ishvara, can only happen through single-pointed devotion. Arjuna came to know Ishvara through Shri Krishna\u2019s teaching, and he also saw Ishvara\u2019s cosmic form. But he did not fully merge into it, he was standing out of it.        In this manner, Shri Krishna slowly brings up the topic of the next chapter, which is the yoga of bhakti or devotion. He summarizes this chapter in the next and last shloka."

First, he lists the Vedas, which refer to material and spiritual teachings, give us knowledge to lead a purposeful and ethical life. By encouraging action in life\u2019s early stages, then emphasizing renunciation in the later stages, they get us from harbouring selfish desires to desirelessness. Austerity and charity further reduce our ego, and penance strengthens us internally and externally. Worship invokes Ishvara\u2019s grace and blessings.         However, Shri Krishna reminds us that none of these methods will give us attainment of Ishvara as their result. This point is of such importance that he brings it up for the second time in the same chapter. Each of the means outlined above have their own results which are valid in life\u2019s various stages, but they can only purify us, not give us Ishvara directly. If we don\u2019t understand this, we are like the child who wants to go to a dentist not to take care of a tooth issue, but to get the lollipop at the end of the visit.        Attainment of Ishvara is purely in the hands of Ishvara himself, as we saw earlier. It is his choice as to whom he will bestow his grace upon. But so far, Shri Krishna himself has described that there is no bias in the way he has set up the machinery of the universe. This leads us to believe that Ishvara will not arbitrarily bestow his grace upon anyone randomly. There has to be a logic to it. Shri Krishna reveals this answer next."

In that Upanishad, the young boy Nachiketa approaches the lord of death Yama for spiritual instruction. His most powerful question to Yama is : what happens to the soul after death. Yama tries to distract Nachiketa with boons of wealth and power, but fails. Eventually he responds : \u201cNachikata, even the gods are even anxious to know the answer to this question, and have never been able to figure this out\u201d.         The same language is used by Shri Krishna in this shloka. He says that the gods have desired to see Ishvara\u2019s cosmic form since eternity, but have not been able to do so. It is \u201csudurdarsham\u201d, extremely difficult and rare to see, it is next to impossible. They may have seen Lord Naarayana in his four-armed form, but not the universal cosmic vision seen by Arjuna. And they will probably not see it in their lifetime.        Why is it the case the the gods cannot see this vision? Let\u2019s investigate the nature of gods. They may be more powerful than humans, but they are subject to the three gunaas like every other aspect of creation. Which means that they also are impelled by selfish desires. Even Indra, the king of the gods, starts plotting to remove anyone who has an eye on his throne. So what Shri Krishna means here is that humans, gods, demons, anyone who is part of this creation, will never get to see this cosmic form unless they have a specific quality. Shri Krishna will give a detailed answer to this question soon."

Even the cows, birds, trees and deer are enthralled when they see your beautiful form.\u201d Arjuna, seeing the human form of Shri Krishna, regained his natural state, free from the fear and bewilderment resulting from the cosmic form.        We have come across the meaning of the term \u201cJanaardana\u201d earlier. \u201cArda\u201d means one who moves, or makes others move. Jana means people, and therefore Janaardana means one who moves people to heaven or hell, in other words, dispenses justice to evildoers. Another meaning of Janaardana is one whom people ask for prosperity and well being. By addressing Shri Krishna as Janaardana, a term he used to address Shri Krishna prior to knowing that he was Ishvara, Arjuna recalled the glory of his human form.         So far, we saw Arjuna request Shri Krishna for the cosmic form, Arjuna\u2019s description of the cosmic form and his subsequent reaction to it, followed by a request to revert back to the human form. Now, Shri Krishna summarizes the teaching of this chapter in the the four shlokas that follow."

This ceremony was conducted in a low-key manner so as not to arouse the suspicion of the king Kamsa, who had vowed to finish the progeny of Vasudeva. Vaasudeva also means \u201cone who pervades the universe\u201d.        The eight chapter further describes a story of Shri Krishna\u2019s pranks. Several children approached Yashoda to complain that her son, the baby Shri Krishna, was eating dirt. Angrily, she asked Shri Krishna to open his mouth so that she can know whether he was eating dirt. When he opened his mouth, Yashoda saw a glimpse of the cosmic form inside, with all the planets, galaxies, all of time and space in that tiny mouth. She did not see the fearful version of the cosmic form shown to Arjuna. Immediately afterwards, Shri Krishna erased her memory of this incident.         In this shloka, Sanjaya introduced himself in the commentary to indicate that Shri Krishna ended the fearful cosmic form, then assumed his four armed form, and then the pleasant two armed form that Arjuna knew and loved. Shri Krishna held a whip in one hand and the reins of the chariot in another. Just like a father scolds his children and immediately pacifies them, he pacified Arjuna and ensured that his state of mind returned to normal. This is reflected in the next shloka where the chanting meter also reverts back to the \u201canushtubh chandha\u201d, the default meter for chanting the Gita."

He used the word \u201cprapashya\u201d meaning \u201cbehold\u201d, urging Arjuna not to look away, that the familiar form of Shri Krishna was on its way.        Unlike Arjuna, we have not seen the grand sweep and scale of the cosmic form. But, our daily life is part of that very universe, so whatever Shri Krishna says to Arjuna is also applicable to us. The terrors, the destructive forces in the universe usually create fear and agitation in our minds. Shri Krishna urges all of us to go about our lives with a fearless attitude and a pleasant mind, because he is present in everything. Only when we forget this fact will we create fear and agitation.        Ultimately, the root of all sorrow and fear is delusion, the confusion between right and wrong knowledge. In Arjuna\u2019s case, it was the delusion created by attachment to his relatives. In our case, it is our attachment to our body, to our possessions, to our family, our job, our position, the list goes on and on.

We see this during our lifetime in the present day. To understand this, let us look at our pre-sleep rituals. We make the bed, we turn off the light, we lie down and close our eyes. Some of us read a book or listen to music afterwards. We know, however, that these are mere aids to encouraging sleep. If our body isn\u2019t ready to sleep, none of these aids will work.        Similarly, Shri Krishna says that moksha or liberation cannot be attained simply by studying the scriptures, or by performing elaborate rituals, charity or severe penance. All these prescriptions are helpful in purifying our mind, in purging it of selfishness and individuality. When our mind is immaculate through the disciplined observance of these presceptions, it becomes fit to receive knowledge about the eternal essence through a qualified teacher. That is the only way by which we will realize the true nature of Ishvara and the eternal essence.        In most cases, we see people ardently take up different techniques of worship, penance, study and so on, but tend to get so attached to those techniques that they lose sight of the real goal which is liberation. They go so far as to claim the efficacy of one technique versus the other. Also, the eternal essence is our true nature and beyond the realm of action, as we saw in the second chapter. Nothing eternal can arise from action, as action always creates impermanent effects. Nothing that we create, or that nature has created, is eternal. Even the earth that outlives all of us will one day be destroyed. Therefore, Shri Krishna congratulates Arjuna by reminding him that it was only due to compassion that Arjuna could behold the universal form."

Arjuna was extremely frightened when he saw it. Later, he acknowledged that he could not see it any more and begged Shri Krishna to stop showing it. In this shloka, Shri Krishna reassured Arjuna that there was no intent to scare Arjuna through the fearful form. It was only out of his compassion that the fearful cosmic form, a result of Ishvara\u2019s power of maaya, was displayed.        Like Arjuna, we may also want to know why this terrible form was displayed. From a practical standpoint, it is an illustrative reminder to view creation and destruction with equanimity in our lives. Most of us tend to get attached to pleasant and favourable circumstances, and reject or run away from unpleasant circumstances. Ishvara\u2019s universal form has room for both, and gives equal validity to both these aspects. Through this form. Shri Krishna wants us to view the same Ishvara in all aspects of life, pleasant and unpleasant.         Furthermore, Shri Krishna wanted to again caution us against objectifying this universal form, in other words, to think of ourselves as unique and distinct from it. We are part and parcel of that universal form, it is not outside us. To drive home this point, he summarizes the key aspects of this form. It is full of luster (tejomaya), it is that which is all pervading (vishwam), it is infinite (anantam), it is primal and beginningless (aadyam). He also points out the exclusivity of this form to Arjuna, which is elaborated in the next shloka."

Terming a four-armed figure as a normal form may seem strange. We need to dig deeper into the symbolic aspect of the number four to understand this request properly. The number four has a deep significance in the scriptures, since it represents the four Vedas, the four Varnas or classes, the four aashramas or stages, and the four purushaarthaas or aims of life. As an example, let us explore the four aashramas.         A person is supposed to pass through four aashramas or stages during their life. They begin life under the instruction of a guru or teacher, with the sole aim of seeking knowledge. This stage is called brahmacharya. After graduating from their school, they then lead the life of a householder in the grihastha stage. When that is fulfilled, they enter into a stage where they begin to gradually renounce all material attachments. This is known as vaanaprastha. After complete renunciation, a person\u2019s life culminates in the sanyaasa stage where there sole aim is spiritual pursuits.         In this manner, we can uncover the significance behind several aspects of the number four. But what Arjuna really meant to convey to Shri Krishna was a request to assume the form that his admirers and devotees loved the most, the form that was the object of their meditation. This was Shri Krishna\u2019s form as Lord Naaraayana, which was the embodiment of peace and serenity, and a polar opposite of his rudra or terrible form that Arjuna wanted to go away."

At some point or the other in our lives, we have encountered fear of losing our job, losing a loved one, fear of an angry confrontation, stage fright and so on. But we can boil all kinds of fear down to three things. First, the fear of losing something that is \u201cours\u201d. This is the fear of losing our life, our job, our loved ones and so on. Next is the fear of loss of knowledge, or being duped. Third is the fear of losing joy and happiness, fear of sorrow in other words. We can sum it up in this manner: we are afraid of losing our existence, knowledge and happiness.        However, if we recall the teaching of the Gita so far, especially from the second chapter, we know that our true nature is the aatmaa, the eternal essence which is infinite existence, knowledge and happiness. So then, the cause of fear is the ego, the delusion that we are not the eternal essence. There is no scope for fear when we know our true nature as the infinite eternal essence. But if we assume that \u201cI am the body\u201d, then all the problems and fears of the body such as disease, old age, death etc become our problems. The fear of death, which is actually the fear of losing the existence of the body, becomes our fear.        So then, why did Arjuna fear Shri Krishna\u2019s cosmic form? For a brief moment, Arjuna\u2019s ego had vanished when he considered himself part and parcel of the cosmic form. When his ego came back, it brought with it all the incorrect associations with the body, mind and so on. Arjuna then saw the cosmic form as something outside of himself, something that could destroy him. He acknowledged his fear to Shri Krishna, begging him to go back to his original form."

The two birds are friends. One bird, symbolizing the human condition, is completely engrossed in enjoying the fruit of the tree. This bird doesn\u2019t realize that it has developed an attachment to the fruit, and that the fruit will eventually become the cause of its sorrow. Similarly, we do not realize that the more we get stuck in objects, the more the objects get stuck to us. The Gita has repeatedly pointed out this theme.         Now, the second bird on that branch symbolizes the Ishvara principle. It does not get attached to the fruit, it simply watches the show as a passive onlooker. The first bird is so engrossed in its sense enjoyments that it never pays attention to the second bird. Like Arjuna, and like all of us, the first bird is stuck in the delusion of the material world. The moment the first bird stops its indulgence and looks at the second bird, its bondage is snapped. Without the help of this Ishvara principle, we cannot extricate ourselves from the pull of the senses. For most of us, this Ishvara principle is our teacher, our guru.         So through this shloka, we are instructed to completely surrender ourselves in prostration to that Ishvara principle. When Arjuna undertook a \u201csaashtaanga namaskaara\u201d, a total surrender of his body through prostration, he referred to SHri Krishna as his friend, recalling the illustration of the two birds who were friends. Arjuna asked for a father\u2019s forgiveness, a friend\u2019s forgiveness and the beloved\u2019s forgiveness \u2013 three categories of forgiveness since he wanted all of these from Shri Krishna."

Who is an ideal parent? Any parent should obviously provide physical and emotional nourishment to their children. But ideal parents also become the greatest gurus, the greatest teachers, for their children. Only when parents teach the right knowledge and values do they become worthy of being worshipped by their children. Symbolically speaking, Ishvara is the ideal parent because he is the ultimate cause of this universe that is made up of sentient and insentient objects.         Arjuna also refers to Ishvara as the ultimate overlord of the three worlds. Traditionally, we think of these three worlds as referring to heaven , hell and earth. Another meaning of the three worlds is the three states in which we exist. In the day, we exist in the waking state where our intellect, our faculty of logic and reason is active. In the night, we go into our dream state, where our intellect is shut off but our mind creates whole new dream worlds. We then go into a state of deep sleep, where neither the mind nor the intellect functions.         Though we keep going through all three states daily, the sense that \u201cI exist\u201d is common. The Mandukya Upanishad uses this analysis to reveal the nature of the eternal essence. In this shloka, Arjuna asserts that Ishvara is with us as the \u201cI am\u201d principle in all of these three states of waking, dream and deep sleep. To this great being, Arjuna surrenders his ego by declaring that there is nothing else in the entire universe like Ishvara."

He used phrases like \u201cdo not view a brahmin different that an outcaste\u201d, \u201cview gold and clay as the same\u201d, \u201cone who views friends, enemies and well wishers with the same vision is superior\u201d.  But when Arjuna examined his past treatment of Krishna, he found that he did not live up to that standard.        Now that he had received the knowledge of equanimity from Shri Krishna, Arjuna wanted to confess his misbehaviour and ask for forgiveness from Shri Krishna. He acknowledged that his behaviour was purely driven by ignorance and jest. It is said in the Mahaabhaarata that Arjuna was fond of pulling pranks on Shri Krishna during their childhood days. He once pulled a chair on which Shri Krishna was about to sit. He wanted to reassure Shri Krishna that in all those pranks, he meant no malice whatsoever.        As he implored for forgiveness, Arjuna addressed Shri Krishna as \u201cachyuta\u201d, one who never falls from his position, asserting that Shri Krishna\u2019s conduct was beyond reproach, that he practised what he preached. He also addressed him as \u201caprameyam\u201d, one who is so infinite that he cannot be measured. Forgiveness can only come from one who has a large heart. Confessing his wrongdoings to Shri Krishna enabled Arjuna to start with a clean slate and begin to follow his teachings."

Growing up together, Arjuna never realized the divine nature of Shri Krishna\u2019s birth. He had treated him as he would treat any other friend of his. Now, having understood his divine nature having viewed the cosmic form, he wanted to acknowledge his ill-treatment of Shri Krishna, and beg for forgiveness for all the times he had acted imprudently. After all he was Arjuna, whose name meant \u201cone who is extremely straight-forward\u201d.        In Arjuna\u2019s time, just like in the present time, insults with respect to people\u2019s skin colour or caste were quite popular. Arjuna recounts his insults to Shri Krishna where he used to call him dark-skinned, refer to his caste, or call him a friend instead of a more respectable title. And like any of us, his intellect knew that insulting anyone was not the right thing to do, but he did it anyway. Knowing this well, Arjuna owned up to his ignorance, carelessness and rash behaviour.        But Arjuna also gave another side of the story. Although he did insult Shri Krishna out of carelessness in some instances, there were other instances when he did it out of sheer affection for his friend. When there is affection from both sides between friends, it is totally acceptable to insult each other. Arjuna was going to ask for forgiveness very soon, and hoped that Shri Krishna would keep this side of the story in his mind."

So far, he thought that it was his might and power that was defeating the Kauravas. But now, after beholding the cosmic form, his pride had dropped completely. In this shloka, he acknowledged that his power and valour came from Ishvara, and that he was only the \u201cnimitta\u201d, the instrument for channeling that power.        Now, we have seen ten chapters of the Gita. Each chapter is called a \u201cyoga\u201d, because it takes us higher and higher in our spiritual journey if we can understand and implement its teaching. In the previous chapter, Shri Krishna wanted Arjuna to see the one Ishvara in all beings, to see unity in diversity. In this chapter, he wanted Arjuna to see all beings in that one Ishvara, to see diversity ultimately subsumed into unity. Shri Krishna\u2019s goal was fulfilled when Arjuna realized the truth expounded in the Upanishads, declaring here that Ishvara pervades everything, and that he ultimately is everything.        So when he recognized Ishwara as the infinite source of all power and valour, and in fact, the ultimate source and cause of everything, Arjuna could not help but repeatedly offer salutations to that cosmic form. But as we saw earlier, he had lost all notions of space and direction. He did not know what was north or south, or what was up or down. So giddy was his state of mind that he wanted to offer salutations to Ishvara from the front, back and all directions.         Offering our salutations to Ishvara, also known as \u201cvandanam\u201d, is considered one of nine methods of worship. Shree Ramdas Samartha has devoted an entire section of the Dasbodh to describe the glories of vandanam. He considers it one of the simplest and most effective tools to connect with Ishvara. By its very nature, offering salutations or bowing to someone automatically eliminates our ahankaara, our ego, the primary obstacle to connecting with Ishvara.        Having understood the purpose of the cosmic form, Arjuna began to ask for Shri Krishna\u2019s forgiveness next.        Footnotes1. Vandanam is elaborated in the fifth section of the fourth chapter of the Dasbodh."

He saw Ishvara in all the primal forces of nature and listed their presiding deities: Vayu, the lord of wind who sustains all living beings. Yama, the lord of death who ensures justice for everyone. Agni, the lord of fire who provides energy to all beings. Varuna, the lord of life-giving water. Shashaanka, the moon, who nourishes all plants and herbs.        How could Ishvara manifest as all these deities? Because Ishvara functions as Prajaapati, also known as Lord Brahmaa, creator of the universe who brought all the deities into existence. Vedic texts refer to Brahmaa as Hiranyagarbha, the golden womb that brought forth the universe. But Ishvara existed even before Brahmaa was created, he is the Prapitaamaha, the great-grandfather, the original person.        When we are humbled, when we come in the presence of someone who is infinitely more capable than we are, we could have one of two reactions. If we have no respect for that person, we could harbour feelings of resentment and anger. But in this case, Arjuna was humbled by Ishvara for whom he had the utmost reverence. Knowing that the source of the universe was on his side, all he could do was repeatedly prostrate and offer his salutations. Knowing that it was Ishvara who was doing his work all along, Arjuna\u2019s completely surrendered his pride."

He acknowledges Ishvara\u2019s creative power by addressing him as \u201caadideva\u201d, the primal or first lord, the one who created Brahmaa, the creator. He also acknowledges that Ishvara has the power to create \u201canantaroopam\u201d, an infinite number of forms, which is what we experience as \u201cvishwam\u201d, this magnificent universe. The first name of Ishvara in the Vishnu Sahasranaama, the thousand names of Vishnu, is vishwam.        Ishvara has not created the universe and stepped aside from it. He dwells in it as the ancient \u201cpurusha\u201d or person, just like we dwell as the person in our body, the \u201ccity of nine gates\u201d from the fifth chapter. Also, Ishvara is not located in just one specific area or corner of this universe. He is present everywhere. He is the \u201ctatam\u201d in the phrase \u201cyenam sarvam idam tatam\u201d from the second chapter. He pervades this entire creation, just like water pervades all ocean waves.        We know that even an inert object like a TV screen can conjure up an infinite number of names and forms. But Ishvara is far from inert. He is of the nature of awareness, of knowledge. He is the knower of everything that is to be known, all the forms that he has created. And when all these forms are dissolved, they end up in him, the final resting place, the \u201cparama dhaama\u201d or supreme abode."

Here, he justifies why people who have preference for a particular deity were seen offering their salutations to the cosmic form. He says that when we see someone superior in all respects to our deity, there is no reason not to bow to that person. Ishvara in his cosmic form is the original cause, the creator of Lord Brahmaa. Whereas Lord Brahmaa could create several universes, Ishvara creates several Lord Brahmaas. Therefore it is appropriate that people worship Ishvara.        Now, Arjuna described Ishvara as \u201csadasattatparam\u201d. What does that mean? \u201cSat\u201d in this context refers to the manifest world, things that we can perceive with our mind and our senses. \u201cAsat\u201d refers to the unmanifest world comprising our subconscious desires or our vaasanas. In computer terms, Sat is the hardware and asat is the software, the programming stored in memory. Our behaviour is driven by the unmanifest programming of our desires, just like a computer behaves according to its programming.        So, if we were to describe electricity, it would be beyond the hardware and the software. Tiny electrical currents store the software in memory, and powerful electrical currents create the hardware in a factory. Another example we have come across is gold. Five grams of gold can make a necklace, or a bangle, or a biscuit. When the necklace is manifest, all the other shapes become unmanifest. But the gold transcends, it is beyond the manifest and the unmanifest. In the same way, Ishvara transcends the manifest and the unmanifest names and forms in this universe."

As we saw earlier, we tend to question Ishvara every time there is a massive calamity, either at a personal level or at a global level. Or, we sometimes ask Ishvara to let things be a certain way. But when we understand that Ishvara is behind it all, and is orchestrating events for the benefit of the entire universe and not just a subset, we too, are compelled to say \u201csthaane\u201d, it is all right.        With this knowledge, we now know why people in our world are happy and unhappy at the same time. Those who view the world through Ishvara, those who have the vision of Ishvara, take delight in everything and hence they are happy. But those who view the world through their ego-driven vision fear Ishvara\u2019s destructive process, and then become unhappy. Rakshasaas or demons run in fear, while siddhas or perfected beings salute Ishvara.        Furthermore, Arjuna understands a wonderful technique by which we can gain immense dispassion towards the world. A child drops his attachment to his toys when he becomes an adult and gets attached to something higher than toys, like his career for instance. So when we develop a strong attachment to Ishvara, when we are enamoured, \u201canurajjyate\u201d, by Ishvara, we automatically drop our worldly attachments. All we need to do is to direct our senses to Hrisheekesha, the master of the senses.        This shloka and the upcoming ten shlokas are one of the most beautiful prayers to Ishvara ever written."

The fear had not subsided fully, that is why his voice was choked and his body was trembling. Since there was a bit of a gap between Shri Krishna proclamation and Arjuna\u2019s next statement, Sanjaya stepped in to narrate this shloka.        Shri Shankaraachaarya in his commentary adds an extra dimension to Sanjaya\u2019s interjection. Since Shri Krishna had already declared the upcoming death of the Kaurava army\u2019s star warriors, Dhritraashtra could still have had one last opportunity to end the war at this very moment. Without saying it explicitly, Sanjaya asked: would he issue a command to stop the war now? He used the word \u201ccrown\u201d to imply that Arjuna\u2019s coronation as the crown prince of the kingdom was not too far away.        Unfortunately, Sanjaya\u2019s plea fell on deaf ears. Dhritraashtra\u2019s attachment to his sons was so great that even a revelation from Ishvara himself could not unsettle it. But even he knew that the fate of his sons was already sealed. The downward spiral caused by attachment has been illustrated with several examples in earlier chapters of the Gita. Perhaps this example of Dhritraashtra is one of the most hard hitting ones, since attachment to family is something that all of us identify with.        So then, what did Arjuna say to Shri Krishna?

Never in his life had he gane through so many unimaginable visions in such a short span of time. First he saw Ishvara\u2019s pleasant cosmic form, then the fearful cosmic form, then he came to know the real nature of Ishvara\u2019s destructive power, and finally he came to know that every action in the universe was determined by Ishvara. Shri Krishna recognized this state of mind and gave clear, simple and precise instructions to Arjuna : do not worry, just fight.        What was the source of Arjuna\u2019s worry? Even since the war began, Arjuna was fearful of facing the most prominent warriors in the Kaurava army. Shri Krishna pointed them out here, maintaining the hierarchy of seniority: their guru Drona, the grandsire Bheeshma, Jayadratha who was protected by a divine boon, and Karna who was equal to Arjuna in prowess. He mentioned each of their names, implying that their fate was already sealed. There was no point in Arjuna worrying any more.        So then, what could Arjuna do? Shri Krishna said : just fight. Since all these mighty warriors have already killed by me, you kill them, not out of a sense of enmity or superiority, but out of a sense of performing your duty as a karma yogi. You be just be an instrument of Ishvara, that is the idea. Put the teaching of the Geeta into practice. If you perform actions in this manner, you will vanquish your enemies.        Sanjaya stepped in to describe Arjuna\u2019s reaction in the next shloka."

But even though the ending is no surprise to anyone, we still want to sit for over two hours in a movie theatre. Why is that? We enjoy the drama, the emotional ups and downs, the fight sequences, the songs and so on. We want the movie to entertain us. Just because we know the ending, we don\u2019t stop watching movies.         Ishvara\u2019s grand spectacle, his \u201cleela\u201d, works in similar ways. Shri Krishna had pre-planned the ending of the war, and had orchestrated the events in such a manner that it would result in the destruction of the Kauravaas. Knowing this, Arjuna would have liked very much to flee the war. Addressing Arjuna as Savyasaachin, one who could use both his hands in archery, Shri Krishna encouraged him to fight with all his might, defeat his enemies and enjoy the result of his actions. This is because Arjuna, like all of us, had a role to play in Ishvara\u2019s grand play of the universe, his \u201cleela\u201d.         Here is the crux of karma yoga. If we fulfill our duties with a spirit of detachment, we align ourselves with Ishvara\u2019s vision. We become a \u201cnimitta\u201d or an instrument of Ishvara. But if we assert our selfish desires and our will, we only entrap ourselves in the material world and set ourselves up for a painful existence. Furthermore, Shri Krishna, in his generosity, was more than happy to let Arjuna take credit for his work. In fact, he encouraged him to do so. And in the midst of all this, there is no favouritism. The Kauravaas were annihilated as a result of their actions, not because of Shri Krishna\u2019s partiality towards the Pandavaas.        So now, who are the people who would be killed in the war? We shall see in the next shloka."

It is said that Robert Oppenheimer, creator of the atom bomb, uttered this shloka when he saw the power of his creation for the first time. Shri Krishna declared himself to be \u201ckaala\u201d, which means time as well as death. They mean the same thing because in time, everything dies. He also used the word \u201cpravruddha\u201d which means mature or seasoned, indicating that he was well versed in the task of destruction, that it wasn\u2019t a one time thing.   Our mind works within the gamut of space and time, therefore it is difficult to comprehend what Arjuna saw. He probably saw the past, the present and the future happening in an instant, all at the same time. With this vision, Shri Krishna was able to show the future to Arjuna. The Mahaabhaarata war had ended, leaving few Kaurava warriors alive. In other words, Shri Krishna himself had determined that the war would be won by the Paandavas. They fought like any other army would, but the real work behind the scenes was done by Shri Krishna.   Many of us sometimes think, what will happen if I stop working one day? Lest we attach undue importance to our actions and puff up our ego, Shri Krishna gives us a lesson in humility. He reveals that ultimately, it is he who is running the show. If he wants to do something, he will do it with whatever means available, even if it means generating a thought in one person or in a million people.   Now, if we hear this, we may think, why should I do anything at all? I can retire right away since it is ultimately Ishvara who is doing everything. Arjuna probably had the same thought. He would have wondered what was the need for him to fight, reinforcing the argument he made in the first chapter when we wanted to run away from the war.   Anticipating this, Shri Krishna makes a bold statement in the next shloka."

He then proceeds to destroy Hiranyakashipu\u2019s army. But his anger is not appeased even after doing so. Extremely scared and worried, the heavenly deities send Prahalaada, Lord Vishnu\u2019s devotee, to talk to Narasimha. He first praises Lord Vishnu, after which he asks him several questions. Appeasement, followed by humble questioning, is the best way to pacify an angry person, which is what Arjuna did to the fearful cosmic form of Ishvara in this shloka.        In the course of just a few moments, Shri Krishna transformed from his human form, to a gigantic cosmic form that was pleasing, then to another cosmic form that was extremely scary. Arjuna requested him to reveal who he was at this moment, and what was his mission and purpose for destroying everything. Even in his request there was humility and surrender, because Arjuna asked for the Lord\u2019s grace, knowing fully well that he was the \u201cAadyam\u201d, the original primal being of this universe.        The word \u201cAadyam\u201d is used by Sant Jnyaneshwar in the first stanza of his commentary on the Gita known as the Jnyaaneshwari : \u201cOm Namoji Aadya\u201d, meaning \u201cmy salutations to that primal being\u201d. This word is extremely significant in the context of this shloka. For someone or something to take on the responsibility of destruction, it has to be present before and after creation. It also has to be beyond all names and forms, because it is names and forms that are created and destroyed. So when the entire universe is dissolved, the same original being creates, sustains and destroys the universe again."

It is a sign that we would like to have more. Also in Indian culture, wasting of food is not allowed, so we lick our fingers to ensure that nothing goes to waste. In the same way, Ishvara in his cosmic form thoroughly enjoys the process of destruction. He also ensures that nothing is spared, nothing goes to waste. Everything and everyone ultimately is destroyed.        Now, we may ask, isn\u2019t it cruel to derive pleasure from destruction? It may be true from a relative standpoint, but not from the absolute standpoint. If old trees and animals do not die in a jungle, new ones cannot be created. If old businesses aren\u2019t allowed to fail, new startups cannot bring innovative products to the market. If no one dies, the earth is unable to sustain the needs of an infinitely growing population.         Destruction is a necessary part of life. If we think like an individual, destruction is painful. If we think like Ishvara, destruction is enjoyable. It also creates dispassion towards the miseries of our human body, since we know it will eb  destroyed to create something new.        Arjuna continues to describe what he sees. He says that the rays of fire that are emitted by Shri Krishna are burning up the universe with their heat. He wants to take those fiery rays away. Since Shri Krishna has not yet listened to him, he asks him a question with the hope of gaining attention, and potentially, bringing back the form of Shri Krishna that he loves."

Some may raise a doubt here. They may say, water is inert so naturally it goes wherever the flow takes it. In order to dispel this doubt, Arjuna gives the example of moths that rush towards a flame, and are eventually destroyed. Sant Jnyaneshwar gives the example of water droplets evaporating on a hot iron rod in his commentary.        By showing the process of destruction at such a grand scale, Shri Krishna also wants to remove Arjuna\u2019s fear of death. Since the physical body goes away after death, there is no question of pain once we die. We are scared not about the pain of death, but about losing all of our identity as a so-and so, with all his possessions and attachments. The name and form that we have become attached, and its network of relationships with other names and forms, is what ultimately gets dissolved.        But when we know that death is nothing but a return of our name and form into that of Ishvara\u2019s, our fear of death will go away, or at least, diminish to a great extent. In fact, when we become a devotee of Ishvara, death loses its unpleasantness because now it means a return to the original source of the universe. We begin to lead our lives with a great degree of courage and fearlessness, because we know how it will all end."

These are names of just a handful of 1100 rivers that feed the Amazon, the largest river in the world by volume. It covers almost 7 million square kilometres of land in South America, and empties 300,000 cubic metres per second into the Atlantic Ocean. The most distant source of the Andes is a glacier on the western edge of South America, near the Pacific Ocean, on the other side of the continent.        Arjuna, on seeing the hordes of warriors rushing into Ishvara\u2019s mouths, compares them to the water in a river rushing with great speed into the ocean. It reminds him of Shri Krishna\u2019s description of the water cycle as a sacrifice when he was explaining karma yoga. A drop of water which originated from the ocean evaporates into the sky, falls down as rain into a water body, and eventually finds its way into a flowing river that goes right back into its source, the ocean. At one point it thinks that it is rain, or it is a pond, a lake, a stream and so on, forgetting its true nature as water.        Similarly, we tend to think of ourselves as children, students, engineers, executives, rich people, poor people at different points in our lives, and forgetting that our journey is just a cycle that begins from Ishvara, the source, and ends back into that same source. So even though Arjuna was scared of Ishvara\u2019s monstrous form, he understood that there was nothing to be scared about destruction. It was a bona fide part of Ishvara\u2019s creative process.        Arjuna illustrates another aspect of this scene in the next shloka."

He now saw several warriors from both armies rushing to enter the numerous mouths of Ishvara\u2019s cosmic form. He also saw Ishvara devouring these warriors, with the remnants of his meal stuck between the gaps of his teeth. Arjuna uses the word \u201cchoornit\u201d meaning powder to highlight the force of Ishvara\u2019s jaws and their impact on the warriors.        This gruesome scene serves to remind us of the ephemerality of the material world comprised solely of names and forms. If Ishvara can create the variety of names and forms in his pleasant form, he can also dissolve that variety in his terrible form. Arjuna saw this vision quite clearly, as did many people in the northeastern United States that were impacted recently by the most powerful hurricane in history. Ishvara\u2019s power can level entire towns within minutes.        Another intriguing aspect of this shloka is that Ishvara\u2019s cosmic form isn\u2019t going after all the warriors, in fact, they themselves are rushing into his mouths. It reinforces the message given by Shri Krishna earlier. Ishvara does not favour or hate anyone. Every individual creates his own destiny by the fruit of his choices and actions. The Kauravas and Paandavas decided to engage in a war, so it was natural that many of them would end up dead when the war ended.        Now, knowing that Shri Krishna could show him the future, Arjuna was curious to know whether he would win or lose. But he did not ask this question directly. He continued describing the scene, hoping that Shri Krishna would reveal it eventually."

Among all the scenes shown on the canvas of the cosmic form, Arjuna began to see the Mahabhaarata war. However, he saw things that had not happened so far. In other words, Shri Krishna was showing him the future.        Maaya, Ishvara\u2019s great power, creates space and time. Space and time create the sense of separateness between us and the universe. Both space and time are interrelated. The larger the space, the more time it takes to go from one corner to another. A fish can traverse a bowl much faster than it can traverse a giant aquarium tank. Only Ishvara, who is beyond the notion of space and time, could show a scene that was to occur in the future, like a movie director who solely knows the outcome of a script.        Earlier, Shri Krishna had destroyed all notion of space, since it appeared that everyone and everything had congealed together in his cosmic form. Now, he began eliminating the notion of time. Arjuna could see the past, present and future all at once in the cosmic form. He now saw the Paandava and the Kaurava armies in that scene. He had a special place of dislike for Karna, calling him \u201cthat son of a Suta\u201d. Suta refers to one whose mother is a brahmin andfather is a kshatriya.

He is unable to \u201cknow the directions\u201d, unable to decide where to run away from here. All the plans he has made to do this or that thing are suddenly no more. Many people who come face to face with their mortality may have thoughts similar to what Arjuna is echoing here.        I came across a website of a terminal cancer patient who wrote his obituary just before he passed away. Here\u2019s an excerpt from that website:        \u2026It turns out that no one can imagine what\u2019s really coming in our lives. We can plan, and do what we enjoy, but we can\u2019t expect our plans to work out. Some of them might, while most probably won\u2019t. Inventions and ideas will appear, and events will occur, that we could never foresee. That\u2019s neither bad nor good, but it is real.        I think and hope that\u2019s what my daughters can take from my disease and death. And that my wonderful, amazing wife _____ can see too. Not that they could die any day, but that they should pursue what they enjoy, and what stimulates their minds, as much as possible\u2014so they can be ready for opportunities, as well as not disappointed when things go sideways, as they inevitably do\u2026        So when we realize that ultimately, we are powerless in front of the grand scheme of the cosmos, our ego drops all its pretenses and surrenders itself in prayer to Ishvara. Prayer is only possible when there is utter surrender of individuality. So Arjuna prays to Shri Krishna, urging him to return to his pleasing form. But Shri Krishna is not done yet."

He says that it \u201ctouched the sky\u201d. Its size, combined with the horrible imagery that he saw, created a sight that was scarier than anything we can imagine. Arjuna says that it had an infinite number of colours, indicating the potential to create all kinds of names and forms. Furthermore, it had an infinite number of mouths wide open with fangs, as well as gigantic fiery eyes.        This \u201craudra roopa\u201d or angry form of Ishvara had quite an impact on Arjuna. He admitted to Shri Krishna that he had lost his courage. For one of the world\u2019s foremost warriors that considers courage paramount to say such a thing indicates that this cosmic form must really have been something beyond the realm of our imagination.        Arjuna also admitted that he had lost all his serenity. In the second chapter, Shri Krishna mentioned that a \u201csthita-prajnya\u201d or one who is established in the eternal essence has three key qualities: holistic vision, serenity of mind, and unattached living. Arjuna was a tranquil person by nature, but this manifestation of the cosmic form has the effect of destabilizing him.        From our perspective, even if we never see this terrible form, there are several instances in our life when we experience situations that make us lose our will to fight, and also take our serenity away. This shloka urges to recognize Ishvara\u2019s handiwork behind even those situations that make us lose faith in him, and to constantly remind ourselves that every unfortunate circumstance is a means for our self-purification.        Even though Arjuna wanted Shri Krishna to end displaying this cosmic form, there was more to come as we shall see next."

The \u201csoumya roopa\u201d or the pleasant form morphed into into the \u201cugra roopa\u201d, the fear-inducing form. Shri Krishna\u2019s kind, shining face was no more visible. It now was the face of a monster, with long sharp teeth that were \u201ckaarala\u201d, ready to take a bite.        When we see someone who has power but is benevolent and kind, we feel at peace. But when someone with power is clearly intent on causing destruction, we are afraid. When a general of a country army is disciplined and respects civilian authority, people are happy, otherwise he becomes a dictator and scares people. So therefore, seeing this terrible form of Ishvara, Arjuna saw that all beings in all of the worlds were cowering in fear of this form.        Why did Ishvara show this form to Arjuna? Didn\u2019t Shri Krishna want everyone to remember his pleasant form only? There is a reason to this. Earlier, we learned about the tendency of our mind to demarcate certain aspect of the world as \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d. But if we use the cosmic form as a means to meditate upon Ishvara, we need think like Ishvara. Ishvara comprises the entire creation where everything is necessary and everything has its place. We cannot demarcate anything good or bad. Only by discarding our prior conceptions of good and bad can we truly understand this terrible form of Ishvara.        What else about the form scared Arjuna? He continues in the next shloka."

For most people during Arjuna\u2019s time, deities were worshipped but were inaccessible, they were invisible. Arjuna was clearly delighted to see those deities that were only invoked and worshipped in rituals. Even though these deities may have had meaning to Arjuna, they may not have meaning to many of us. So let\u2019s look more closely at these deities from our standpoint.        We may not worship the Vedic and Puraanic deities mentioned in this shloka, but we do worship material deities. If we want a telephone connection, we approach the telephone company. If we want an internet connection, we approach the internet service provider. If we want to admit a child into school, we approach the principal of that school. Broadly speaking, when we want to access something that is beyond our reach, we approach a deity and convince them to give us access to what we desire.        In all these cases, there are three aspects \u2013 the individual, the object of desire, and the deity that connects the individual to the object of desire. In many ancient texts, it is said that the universe split into 3 parts during the process of creation. The individual is known as the \u201cadhyaatma\u201d, the world of objects known as the \u201cadhibhoota\u201d and the presiding deity that connects the two, the \u201cadhidaiva\u201d.         It is said that we should worship a deity if we are seeking to acquire certain traits. If one wants to acquire strength and power, he should appease that adhidaiva who presides over a storehouse of strength. So we see that seekers of power worship Lord Hanumaan. Seekers of dispassion worship Lord Shiva. Seekers of knowledge worship Sarasvati and so on.         So when we begin practicing meditation, we can choose a deity that we have a particular attraction to. Some people love to worship Shri Krishna in his childhood for, whereas some people worship Lord Shiva in his serene form. It does not matter which deity we choose as long as we use the deity to ultimately take our meditation all the way up to Ishvara."

Previously, he had mentioned that all the three worlds were quite afraid of Ishvara\u2019s fearful form. In one of those worlds, the heavenly world which was populated by the deities, he saw something quite amazing. The deities were arising out of Ishvara\u2019s cosmic form and dissolving back into it, just like waves in the ocean. He indicates this by using the word \u201cvishanti\u201d, entering into.        This shloka brings out the different kinds of people with regards to their spiritual awareness. First, there are those who are completely engrossed in the material world of names and forms. They have very little to no awareness of the unity of things, of the presence of Ishvara in everything, due to extreme entanglement with their senses. Next, there are those seekers who have recognized the presence Ishvara, and are working hard to turn themselves towards the higher. Finally, there are those rare few who have transcended all names and forms, who have realized the absolute.        Arjuna saw all three types of people, the ignorant, the seekers, and the realized masters in this scene. The ignorant individuals and the seekers were dissolving into Ishvara, but only the seekers were singing praises of Ishvara since they knew that he was their ultimate goal. The realized masters, the sages and siddhas, stood apart from this process of creation and dissolution, singing hymns to glorify Ishvara."

They do this by first taking a snapshot of a scene, and then differentiating between what is space is what is not. If they can do this differentiation correctly, they can compare the outlines of the \u201cnot-space\u201d with outlines of familiar objects to arrive at a conclusion such as \u201cthis is a box\u201d and so on.        Our eyes work in pretty much the same way. Whenever they see space, they do three things. First, they separate whatever they see as not-space and call those things \u201cobjects\u201d. Next, they send those objects to the mind which uses its memory to say \u201cthis is a box and a key\u201d. But in addition to recognizing objects, the mind also automatically adds another thought. Since the box and key are separated by space, they are far away from me and therefore not a part of me.        Our minds are conditioned to believe that Ishvara is sitting somewhere far away. He is separated from us by space, by distance. But when Arjuna saw the cosmic form, he realized that space is not different from Ishvara. In fact, Shri Krishna himself said that space is part of his nature in the seventh chapter. Ishvara is not separate and far away from us, he is with us all the time. In fact, he only exists, \u201cekena\u201d, all alone, by himself. We are not different from him. This is the main point of this shloka. Only by constantly remembering the cosmic form will we truly understand this message.        Now, Ishvara\u2019s ugra roopa, his terrible form, slowly replaces his saumya roopa, his pleasant for. For every pleasant experience in the world, there has to be a corresponding unpleasant experience as well. Once you label something as \u201cgood\u201d, there will be something \u201cbad\u201d by default. Seeing this frightful form of Ishvara, with fire coming out of all his mouths, all the three worlds were beginning to worry."

He repeatedly tried to search for the beginning, middle and end of Ishvara\u2019s cosmic form, but fails to do so. He does find something for his mind to hold onto. The moon and the sun are seen as the eyes of the cosmic form. This is useful because it lets us, to the best of our mind\u2019s ability, as a pointer to remembering Ishvara\u2019s cosmic form when we see the moon or the sun.        Next, Arjuna describes Ishvara\u2019s powerful prana shakti. Our prana powers all of our physiological functions. It enables us to digest food, move our hands and legs, circulate the blood and so on. Similarly, the cosmic prana of Ishvara also powers the universe, but is infinitely more powerful than our prana. This is revealed through the infinite arms seen by Arjuna, that represent the infinite prowess and power to perform actions.        Now, Arjuna begins to see a transformation in the cosmic form. It shifts from a pleasant picture to something a little different. Ishvara\u2019s mouth begins to emit fire, representing the prana in him that consumes food. The food here, however, refers to the offerings we make in the form of sacrifices. The offering, or \u201chutam\u201d, is consumed by Ishvara resulting in the fire from his mouth heating or powering the universe. This image reinforces the sacrificial wheel of the universe that was described in the third chapter."

Arjuna praises Ishvara\u2019s cosmic form, and also reveals his understanding of the relationship between Ishvara and the eternal essence. It is similar to the relationship between the ocean and water that we have seen several times before.        The ocean is the foundation in which several waves are created, sustained and destroyed. Each of those waves thinks that it is separate from the ocean, and is also aware of its mortality. But the water in the ocean and the water in the wave is the same. It is indivisible, eternal, infinite and imperishable. All waves are subject to the universal laws of gravity \u2013 whatever goes up, must come down.        Similarly, Ishvara is the foundation which creates, sustains and dissolves this universe of names and forms. Each being thinks that it is separate from Ishvara, and is trapped in sorrow because of its finitude. It does not realize that it is the dweller or the Purusha, made up of the very same eternal essence that Ishvara is, like the ocean and the wave are made up of water. Also, all beings are subject to the universal law of karma, of actions generating results. Ishvara is praised as the protector of this law.        The Gita repeatedly urges us to discard all sectarian notions we have of Ishvara. Next time, when we prostrate in front of Ishvara in the form of a deity, we should try to think of Ishvara in the form that is described here."

The mace and discus that he saw are weapons of Lord Vishnu. They symbolize spiritual discipline and the destructive power of time, respectively. Another symbol of Lord Vishnu is the conch, which symbolizes a call to action and a rebuke against lethargy. Arjuna also sees a crown because Ishvara is the ultimate commander and does not move under the control of any selfish desires.        \u201cThe blazing fire of sunlight\u201d, \u201cabundance of brilliance everywhere\u201d \u2013 these poetic phrases convey the light of the eternal essence that Arjuna saw in the cosmic form. It is the same eternal essence that resides within all of us, but is covered with a layer of avidya or ignorance. As we have seen earlier, the eternal essence inside us enables our mind, intellect, senses and body to function. Ishvara, the purest embodiment of the eternal essence, shines like an infinite number of suns, without anything to obstruct its brilliance.        Now, no matter how hard he tried, Arjuna was not able to accurately capture his experience in words. This is because the eternal experience is not an object that can be perceived with the senses and described by our mind and intellect. He admits this limitation of his mind by declaring that the cosmic form is \u201caprameyam\u201d, it is incomprehensible."

He now sees an infinite number of forms, but his mind cannot in any way comprehend or point out what is being seen. It is only able to process parts of this image \u2013 hands, mouths, eyes and so on, but is not able to make sense of the whole picture. The fable of the blind men who could only touch parts of the elephant comes to mind here. One blind man thought that the trunk was a rope, the ear was a sieve and so on, but they did not realize that they were touching an elephant.        When Arjuna could not figure out how the various eyes, hands, bellies and mouth fit together, he tried to see whether the entire cosmic form had a shape or an outline to it. As a warrior, he was trained to look at a gigantic military formation and make sense of it based on its shapre. But his mind failed there as well. He was not able to locate where that cosmic form began, where its middle was, and where it ended. All our mental functions are useless when we cannot distinguish one thing from another.        We may be tempted to visualize the cosmic form based on some artistic rendition of this shloka that we would have seen in our childhood, especially when we were growing up in India. Most paintings of this shloka show Shri Krishna as a tall entity with many arms, legs and faces but we can still see the battlefield where he is standing on. However, Arjuna was completely engulfed and surrounded by this cosmic form in all three dimensions, \u201cfrom all sides\u201d as the shloka reads. It is impossible for a human to visualize and capture it accurately in a painting.        Through this shloka, Shri Krishna reveals the limitations of the mind with its tendency to chop up everything into fragments. It fails to understand Ishvara\u2019s mind which is operating at the cosmic level. Our thoughts are limited to what we consider \u201cme\u201d and \u201cmine\u201d, but Ishvara\u2019s thoughts take the entire universe into account. Furthermore, it also indicates that all names and forms arise from Ishvara and merge back into Ishvara."

Arjuna now comes out of his silence and speaks at a fast pace to describe what he sees in front of him. The meter of this shloka has changed to indicate the change in pace. Traditionally, these shlokas are also chanted at a slightly faster speed to get their full flavour. So what does Arjuna see?        Arjuna says that he sees all kinds of deities and other kinds of beings, which include Lord Brahma seated upon a lotus, as well as the divine sages and divine serpents. The sages include the sapta-rishis such as Vashishtha and the serpents include Vasuki. We had come across these and other beings in the prior chapter when Ishvara himself described his divine manifestations. But Arjuna does not see all of these in different places. He sees them all situated on Ishvara\u2019s cosmic form.        What does this indicate? The sages live on earth, the deities live in a higher plane, and serpents live in yet another plane. Arjuna realizes that he is seeing worlds that beyond the earth and beyond the human capacity of vision. He also saw Lord Brahma who, according to Srimad Bhagavatam, arose out the navel of Lord Vishnu and created all the worlds.        So Arjuna, in the cosmic form, saw the creator and his creation. More importantly, he realized that Ishvara was beyond the process creation, which he had learned in the eighth chapter.         Footnotes1. \u201cEesham\u201d could also mean Lord Shiva. This indicates that Arjuna saw both creation and dissolution in the cosmic form."

Once the extent of the shock receded to some extent, he gained back his faculties and mustered the energy to start speaking again.        Another aspect of this shloka is revealed by the phrase \u201cbowed his head to the lord\u201d. Arjuna, scion of the great Kuru dynasty was a proud warrior, one of the finest archers in the land. There were few instances in his life where he faced a situation that would have humbled him. Seeing the entire universe in one tiny corner of the cosmic form put his accomplishments in the right perspective, taking all his pride away. He realized that he was nothing, his greatness was nothing compared to the glory of that infinite Ishvara.        So whenever we feel we have accomplished something great, whenever our ego starts to puff up, or even when we feel our personal problems are weighing down upon us, we should do what Arjuna did: fold our hands and bow our head to Ishvara. Our feats and problems are tiny compared to the expanse and power of Ishvara\u2019s universe.        Arjuna begins to describe Ishvara\u2019s cosmic form in the next shloka."

Now that his vision became a little clearer, he saw the entire universe with the earth, the sky, the oceans, animals, plants, trees and humans in one tiny corner of that vast cosmic form.        Sant Jnyanadeva provides some illustrations to convey the how small the universe looked. It was like a few atoms on Mount Meru, a few bubbles in the vast ocean and an ant-hill on planet earth. Such was the vastness of the cosmic form that even our universe looked puny. In the Srimad Bhagavatam, we see a similar description. Yashoda saw herself and her village in a tiny corner of the universe that was situated in the yawning toddler Shri Krishna\u2019s mouth.        In this shloka, Arjuna quite literally saw \u201cthe big picture\u201d. Like us, he was concerned and preoccupied with his problems, his challenges and his worries. He now came face to face with \u201cananta koti brahmanda naayaka\u201d, the lord of an infinite number of universes.

Some scientists who have witnessed nuclear explosions have also used similar language to describe something that is bright beyond comparison.        So where does this radiance come from? Let us investigate. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad is one of the primary texts that discusses topics regarding the eternal essence. In one instance, it uses the phrase \u201ceffulgent infinite being\u201d to describe the eternal essence. This is the source of the radiance. We never get to experience it because it is covered up by the material world. In this case, Shri Krishna enabled Arjuna to see the infinite light and radiance of the eternal essence in its pristine form.        We also have to remember that the comparison made by Sanjaya is helpful, but compares two things that are difficult to compare. Even the brilliance of infinite suns is still a brilliance of the material world, whereas Ishvara\u2019s brilliance is divine, far superior that any material brilliance."

Shri Krishna, after giving a hint of Ishvara\u2019s destructive power to Arjuna,  showed his soumya roopa or his pleasing form. In other words, all the five senses and the mind enjoyed taking in this pleasant form. To that end, Arjuna saw Ishvara dressed up in fine clothes and garlands, as well as anointed with divine perfumes.        Another aspect of this form that it did not have a \u201ccentre\u201d. Whenever we try to worship God, we always choose either an idol or an image so that we can focus our thoughts. However, many of us tend to get fixated on one deity, image or idol and consequently shun other deities. Sanjaya, in describing the cosmic form, noted that it had \u201cinfinite faces\u201d. In other words, whenever Arjuna tried to pinpoint one face and say \u201cthis is Ishvara\u201d, he would fail. Shri Krishna did this to remove any prior conceptions of Ishvara that Arjuna would have harboured.        Now, we always need to keep one thing in mind when we contemplate the cosmic form \u2013 there is oneness behind all the diversity. It is all one being, ultimately. Just like the millions of cells, tissues and organs in our body serve one person, all the diversity seen in the cosmic form serves one Ishvara. Our minds are used to dividing things, cutting up things. The cosmic form is meant to reverse that process and unify everything.        Sanjaya used the word \u201cdevam\u201d which means shining to describe this form. He elaborates on this in the next shloka."

First, he reveals the scale and the vastness of the cosmic form by repeatedly using the word \u201caneka\u201d. \u201cAneka\u201d means several but it is used in the sense of \u201cinfinite\u201d here. We can only imagine Arjuna\u2019s state of mind when his friend transformed into this colossal being with infinite number of faces and eyes.        When someone is confronted with such a mighty spectacle, they want to take it all in. The Sistine chapel in the Vatican is an example of an artwork where most people are so overwhelmed with all the details and the complexity that they don\u2019t know where to look. The cosmic form surrounded and engulfed Arjuna to such an extent, there were so many sights to see, that he did not know where should he look and where shouldn\u2019t he look.        Now, as a hint of things to come, Shri Krishna displays both aspects of his personality. On one hand he is decked in fine jewellery and ornaments, creating a sight that is pleasing to the eye. But on the other hand his weapons show another aspect to his personality, that he has the potential to use destructive force if necessary."

The great sage Veda Vyaasa, the compiler of the Mahaabhaarata, chose to switch the narration over to Sanjaya, who was relaying the events to Dhritraashtra, the \u201cKing\u201d that is mentioned in this shloka.        We notice a subtle shift in the language used by Sanjaya. His praise of Shri Krishna is one degree higher than that used by Arjuna. For instance, he refers to Shri Krishna as \u201cMahaa Yogeshwara\u201d whereas Arjuna uses \u201cYogeshwara\u201d. It is because Sanjaya knew Shri Krishna more thoroughly and deeply than Arjuna did. Moreover, he was already blessed with divine vision through Vyaasa, which enabled him to see exactly what Arjuna saw.        Sant Jnyaneshwara\u2019s commentary of this shloka emphasizes Arjuna\u2019s good fortune of being able to view this cosmic form. He lists Lakshmi, Shesha and Garuda as tireless servants of Lord Vishnu who have yet to see the cosmic form that Arjuna sees, underscoring the love Shri Krishna for his devotee Arjuna. He also enumerates others who were able to see a tiny glimpse of this cosmic form including Yashoda and Dhruva.        So what did this form look like? The description begins in the next shloka."

He realized that Arjuna\u2019s mortal eyes did not have the capability needed to view the cosmic form. So he blessed Arjuna with the \u201cdivya drishti\u201d, the divine vision with which the yoga, the power of creating this diversity in the universe, could be seen in all its majesty.        Before we proceed with the rest of this chapter, let us pause to dig a little deeper into this shloka. Each chapter in the Gita is a \u201cyoga\u201d, a technique for lifting us higher from the material to the divine. Arjuna was bestowed this vision by Shri Krishna, and we will hear a description of that vision from Sanjaya and Arjuna later in the chapter. But if this chapter is meant to give us a practical technique, what are we supposed to do? What does \u201cdivine vision\u201d mean for us?        Let us consider a person from India who is deeply attached to his state or territory. As we have seen repeatedly in the Gita, any sort of deep attachment is a recipe for creating never-ending sorrow. What technique, what yoga could be prescribed for someone in this situation? One could ask that person to get a map of India, look at his state\u2019s border, then mentally erase that border as well as all the other state borders, and see what\u2019s left.        What will he see? He will only see the border of India. There would be no other divisions or distinctions. All conflicts regarding one state versus another would seem meaningless. It does not mean that the sense of attachment has gone away. That is very difficult to achieve. It simply means that the sense of attachment has been raised one step from the relative to the absolute.        Similarly, Shri Krishna asks all of us to view the world with the vision that everything is in Ishvara. Our eyes, limited as they are, will always report divisions and distinctions. That is their nature. But we can always use our intelligence to look through those divisions and see that ultimately, Ishvara is in everything and everything is in Ishvara. If we learn to do this, our attachment to worldly concerns will drop, and shift towards Ishvara.        As we move to the next verse, we will find that the original narrator, Sanjaya, has taken over."

The guest cannot refuse this demand because the family wants him to experience the entire wedding \u201cright here, right now\u201d.        So by using the words \u201cnow\u201d and \u201cin one place\u201d, Shri Krishna is pointing out the power of the Vishwa roopa or cosmic form. Arjuna is able to view the entire universe in one place, without leaving his chariot. Moreover, he is also able to view events that take millions of years in a split second. And what is he able to view? Everything including entities that move, and entities that are stable.        Now, if someone were to offer us the outcome of all the events that were to take place tomorrow, and if our favourite team was contesting a match tomorrow, we would be most interested in learning the outcome of the match. Knowing that Arjuna was most interested in the outcome of the Mahaabhaarata war, Shri Krishna suggested that even that would be visible in his cosmic form. He refers to Arjuna as \u201cGudaakesha\u201d, one who has conquered sleep, so that Arjuna would remain alert while watching the cosmic form.        However, with all this going on, there seemed to be no response from Arjuna. What could be the reason? We shall see next."

These were the twelve Aadityaas, the eight Vasus, the eleven Rudraas, the two Ashvinis and the forty-nine Maruts.        Arjuna would only have read about these deities in the scriptures. Now, he was fortunate enough to see those deities with those own eyes. Shri Krishna calls this fact to his attention by saying that these sights were invisible or inaccessible to everyone else but Arjuna. Also, Shri Krishna repeatedly says \u201cpashya\u201d or behold, to underscore this point.        If a teenager who is an ardent fan of Spiderman somehow manages to meet him in person, what would his reaction be? It is astonishment, \u201caascharya\u201d, which is defined as \u201cthat which makes us go aah\u201d, that which makes our mouth wide open for a very long time.

This entire chapter, written in a poetic style, elaborately describes this form and Arjuna\u2019s reaction to it. It is said that the chanting of this chapter is one of the highest forms of meditation possible.        To get things started, Shri Krishna \u201cturned on\u201d the \u201cscreen\u201d upon which this divine form could be shown to Arjuna. He began by revealing the amount of diversity in the sheer number of colours, shapes and forms that he was about to show to Arjuna. The literal words used are \u201chundreds\u201d and \u201cthousands\u201d, but in essence they mean infinite and innumerable.        While demonstrating the features of the latest LCD TV, the salesman will try his best to show as many channels he possibly can so that the customer is convinced about the capabilities of the TV such as number of pixels, colours and so on. Or if its a sari shop, the salesperson will try to show innumerable varieties of the very same red colour so that the customer is confident about the range and variety in that shop\u2019s inventory.        Shri Krishna, however, was not concerned only with lining up the diversity of forms that he was ready to show. He also wanted to highlight that there was one thing common among that infinite diversity \u2013 Ishvara himself. He indicated this by saying \u201cpashya me roopani\u201d \u2013 behold my forms, not behold all these forms."

Imagine the plight of an movie actor who is absolutely devoted to his craft. He has worked day and nights for a whole year in a movie as a supporting actor. After the shooting ends, he is filled with a burning desire to see the entire movie. Why so? It is because he has only seen the bits and pieces of the movie that he was involved with, and he is not satisfied unless he sees it as a single story, end to end.        Likewise, Arjuna is no longer content with seeing bits and pieces of Ishvara\u2019s expressions. He wants to see how it all comes together as one undivided entity. This is indicated by Arjuna\u2019s use of the word \u201cavyayam\u201d which means undivided, without any discontinuity. And like the only person who can reveal the whole movie is the director, the only person that can reveal the undivided nature of the universe is the \u201cprabhu\u201d, the governor, master and controller.        Now, Arjuna knows that he has to approach Shri Krishna with humility. That\u2019s why he politely says: \u201cshow me that form only if you think that I am qualified to see it\u201d. Morever, Arjuna does not want to imagine it or dream it up, he wants to see it with his eyes, with his \u201cdrishti\u201d. He also refers to Shri Krishna as \u201cyogeshwara\u201d, the teacher of several yogas in the Gita such as karma yoga, dhyana yoga, jnyana yoga and bhakti yoga. The yoga in \u201cVibhooti yoga\u201d is the power that creates variety in the one undivided Ishvara.        So, does Shri Krishna agree to this request? We shall see next."

Why does that happen? Of the five sense organs, the organ of sight is the dearest to us. As they say, \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words\u201d.        Similarly, Arjuna\u2019s curiosity towards Shri Krishna had reached its peak at this point. That is why he asked Shri Krishna, who was the \u201cavatar\u201d or incarnation of Ishvara, to reveal his divine form that was described in the last shloka of the previous chapter. How magnificent would that form be, if this entire universe was sustained by only a fraction of Ishvara, and if all of the divine expressions were contained in Ishvara. In addition to the might and grandeur of this form, Arjuna also wanted to see how everything originated, existed and dissolved within Ishvara, and finally, how everything was Ishvara in essence.        We call something divine when it is endowed with the attributes of knowledge, lordship, power, prowess and brilliance. Arjuna put in a request to Shri Krishna to see that that form, where it is possible to have this vision of many in one. However, the sincere Arjuna did not order to command Shri Krishna to show that form. He qualified his request with a great deal of humility, which we see in the upcoming shloka."

He acknowledges that he has understood the essence of the teaching, which asserts Ishvara as the creator, maintainer and dissolution of the entire universe. In other words, there is no other cause of the universe besides Ishvara. He is both the raw material and the intelligence behind the universe. This \u201cmahaatmyam\u201d or glory was further reinforced in Arjuna\u2019s mind by hearing the divine expressions of Ishvara from Shri Krishna.        However, by addressing Shri Krishna as \u201clotus-eyed\u201d, Arjuna also reveals his understanding of another aspect of Ishvara. Like the lotus that does not get affected by the attributes of its pond, Ishvara does not get personally involved in the workings of the universe. He is impartial to everyone in the granting of results, liberation and bondage. He remains as the \u201cavyayam\u201d or imperishable foundation upon which the mechanical Prakriti projects the multitude of names and forms.        Now, there is a hint of dissatisfaction expressed by Arjuna in this shloka. Even though he has understood the teaching from Ishvara himself, resolved his doubts, and also learnt the techniques of karma yoga and dhyana yoga or meditation, he needs one more thing.

He recalls the root cause of his panic attack from the first chapter which is moha or delusion which caused confusion between his duty as a warrior and as a family member. He now says that his delusion has been dispelled. How did that happen? It is only because Shri Krishna revealed the knowledge of the self, Adhyaatma vidyaa, to Arjuna, the answer to the question \u201cwho am I?\u201d        When Arjuna understood his true nature as the self, the aatmaa, the eternal essence, he came to know that the self does not kill or be killed, it is neither the doer of action or the enjoyer of the results. He then realized that even if his body died, or his body killed another body, nothing would happen to the eternal essence in each of those bodies. Given the power of this knowledge to destroy the biggest delusion about who he was, he terms it \u201cparamam\u201d or supreme. And since it requires a sincere student and a rare teacher, he terms it \u201cguhyam\u201d or secret.        Now, we may think that there was something special in Arjuna that qualified him to receive this supreme knowledge. Arjuna was humble enough to acknowledge that it was purely out of compassion that Shri Krishna showered his grace upon him and gave him this knowledge. Only through the grace and compassion of Ishvara and a qualified guru can one receive this knowledge.        Another aspect of the teaching was Ishvara\u2019s involvement with the universe.

        "content": "When India received independence, the founders wanted to ensure that the newly-created states within India did not disintegrate due to infighting. To that end, they created a two tier government system with a state government that was aligned to state interests, and a central government that put the interests of India before anything else.        Furthermore, in order to ensure that residents of a state did not forget that they are part of a bigger country, our founders instituted the national flag, the national anthem, independence day, republic day, the national emblem and so on. These symbols are expressions, or \u201cvibhootis\u201d of India. They are highly important because they remind us of the existence of the nation of India no matter where we are. They make the abstract concept of the nation of India tangible and visible.        Shri Krishna ended the previous chapter by urging Arjuna, and all devotees, to always keep their minds within Ishvara. In this chapter, Arjuna asked Shri Krishna, \u201chow can I know Ishvara when my eyes cannot see him?\u201d The answer to Arjuna\u2019s question is the main teaching of this chapter, in the form of natural, historic, Puraanic and other awe-inspiring people and objects that serve as Ishvara\u2019s expressions or manifestations.        How do these expressions benefit us? Just like we use symbols of India to constantly invoke the notion of India, we should use one or some or all of these expressions to constantly remember and think of Ishvara. This chapter is not meant to be a lesson in the Puraanas. It is meant to be practiced as a daily meditation, by employing one expression, whichever we like, as the object of our meditation.        So for example, if we have an affinity for the sun, we should bring the shloka \u201caadityaanaamaham vishnuhu\u201d to attention and keep it in our minds as much as possible, whenever we see the sun. This will transform our vision to look beyond the visible aspect of the sun, connect the sun to Ishvara and see the Ishvara inside."

At that point, he would no longer be concerned with trivial details such as checking receipts against journal entries and so on. He would focus on bigger issues such as the financial health of the entire company.        Similarly, when Shri Krishna provided a long list of Ishvara\u2019s expressions, he wanted to ensure that Arjuna did not get stuck at the level of knowing more and more expressions. He wanted Arjuna to stop asking more questions, take a step back and ask himself a very basic question.        If Ishvara is present in everything in the universe, and Ishvara is also present in me, is there anything else in the universe besides Ishvara? In other words, if Ishvara is in everything, isn\u2019t everything in Ishvara ultimately? It is like asking: If there is space in everything including me and including every atom, isn\u2019t everything in space?        With this intriguing thought, Shri Krishna concludes the tenth chapter and sets the stage for the eleventh chapter. While the tenth chapter was about how the one Ishvara was in all, the eleventh chapter is about how all is in the one Ishvara.         om tatsatiti shreematbhagavatgitasupanishadsu brahmavidyaayaam yogashaastre shreekrishnaarjunsamvade vibhootiyogo naama dashamodhyaayaha || 10 ||"

He says that anything that appeals to our mind and senses, any object or person that is endowed with grandeur, perfection, knowledge and power, anything that inspire awe and wonder  is Ishvara\u2019s expression. So we are free to choose anything that meets this criteria.        So if we live in India, the Taj Mahal becomes Ishvara\u2019s expression and in USA, the Grand Canyon. If we like western classical music, the Mahler Symphony No. 9 in D Major becomes Ishvara\u2019s vibhooti and if we like Indian classical music, a rendition by Bhimsen Joshi. An engineer can admire marvels such as the tallest building in the world or the space shuttle. And all of us can admire the thousands of nameless people who are working in NGOs to better the world as yet another expression of Ishvara.        Now, Shri Krishna makes another important point here. If we add up all the glories in the universe, that glory is but a fraction of Ishvara\u2019s glory. Just like we always think of a country\u2019s government whenever we see a police officer, we should always think of Ishvara whenever we see or think of any of his expressions. Arjuna had asked the question as to how he could know Ishvara. With this shloka, Shri Krishna has provided the answer. We use the visible expression to remind us of the invisible Ishvara.        What should we do? Whenever we see something wonderful and glorious, we should remember that the glory is coming from Ishvara, not from that object or person. Next, we should remember that Ishvara is infinitely more powerful and glorious than the object or person. In this manner, we will be able to maintain a constant awareness of Ishvara."

So if everything is divine, why should we seek only a subset of Ishvara\u2019s creations? It is to help us move towards liberation. We tend to be drawn towards people or objects in that universe that naturally attract our senses. If we look at them as mere people or objects, we get bound to them through attachment, which will eventually result in sorrow when we get separated from them. But if we look at them as manifestations of Ishvara, we are automatically protected from further entangling ourselves in samsaara, in the desire-oriented world.        Let us go back to the example of Mr. X and his shiny new car. The seed of sorrow was planted the minute he started considering that \u201cthe car is mine\u201d. Instead, if Mr. X thinks that the car is Ishvara\u2019s creation, he will immediately drop his sense of \u201cmine-ness\u201d from it. Furthermore, he realizes that the car is a temporary object and will eventually cease to exist. He also comes to know that the sense of joy he derives from buying a new car is not from the car, but it is from the presence of Ishvara inside it. So if something happens to the car, he remains unaffected and unperturbed.        Now having gone through the list, we find that a 21st century person like us has difficulty identifying with Puraanic glories that would have been familiar to Arjuna. How should we deal with this issue? Shri Krishna gives the answer in the next shloka."

Having provided a long list of Ishvara\u2019s divine expressions, he now gives us a simple formula to recognize him. He says that whatever we come across in the world, whether it is a living or a non-living entity, or whether it is moving or stationary, it has arisen from the seed that is Ishvara. In other words, Ishvara is the cause or the seed of everything in this universe.        One way of understanding this is as follows. When we refer to an object, let\u2019s say it\u2019s a book, we say : \u201cThis is a book\u201d. There are two aspects pointed out here. First is the book, which is quite obvious. But we also use the word \u201cis\u201d to indicate that the book exists, that the book is visible, and it will be visible to someone else. Shri Krishna says that the very existence of the book, the \u201cis-ness\u201d of the book, is nothing but Ishvara.        In other words, this entire universe will not exist without Ishvara. All of the names and forms in the universe use Ishvara are their basis. If we comprehend this, and develop our vision based on this knowledge, we will automatically see Ishvara everywhere, just like we automatically \u201csee\u201d electricity in every electrical gadget."

As we have seen in the second chapter, dwelling on sense objects can very easily lead to loss of even a wise person\u2019s wisdom and discrimination, which may result in unlawful behaviour. A society without methods to punish criminals is impractical, and will result in anarchy and chaos. From our standpoint, we need to watch our mind and our sense organs constantly, lest they lead us astray.        Next, we look at neeti or strategy. In the Mahabhaarata, Arjuna needed to finish Jayadratha in order to move closer to a victory. But the powerful Jayadratha had obtained a boon from his father. Whoever caused Jayadratha\u2019s head to fall to the ground, their head would split into a hundred pieces. This was a tough situation and needed a smart solution.        Upon Shri Krishna\u2019s advice, Arjuna dispatched an arrow that would sever Jayadratha\u2019s head and deposited it into the lap of his father. When Jayadratha\u2019s father got up, he dropped the head and became the target of his own curse. Shri Krishna, the ultimate strategist, declares strategy as Ishvara\u2019s foremost expression among seekers of victory. Strategy enables us to deal with different people and circumstances, and to devise a plan to win every time.        \u201cSilence is golden\u201d is a proverb that has stood the test of time. In a business negotiation, we may be put in situations where others try to insult us in some way. We face a choice in such situations: we can either snap back at that person or we can stay silent. If we respond, we may say something that may come back to haunt us later. Worse still, we could reveal a secret that puts us in jeopardy.        To that end, Shri Krishna advises us to follow the \u201csilence is golden\u201d proverb by declaring silence as Ishvara\u2019s foremost manifestation among secrets. And those wise people who follow Ishvara\u2019s recommendations also receive their wisdom through Ishvara\u2019s as his divine manifestation."

The Vrishnis are said to have descended from king Yadu who started the major branch of the Chandravanshis, the lunar dynasty. Being the most prominent of the Vrishni clan, Shri Krishna declares himself as Ishvara\u2019s manifestation.        The Bhagavad Gita could never have been possible without Arjuna asking the questions, and without Sage Vyaasa writing the Mahaabhaarata epic. In that regard, Shri Krishna declares both of them as Ishvara\u2019s divine manifestations. Furthermore, both Arjuna and Vyaasa were prominent in their own right. Arjuna was the only undefeated warrior in the Mahaabhaarata war, and also the greatest archer of his time. Sage Vyaasa is credited with having divided the Vedas into four branches, and also with writing the major Puraanaas and the Brahma Sutra.        The word \u201cKavi\u201d means one who is a visionary, one who can foresee what is coming due to the mastery of his academic prowess. Ushana, also known as Shukraachaarya, is revered in the Indian tradition as one of the foremost gurus or teachers. He learnt the technique of reviving the dead from Lord Shiva, also known as Sanjeevani vidya. He later became the guru of the asuraas or demons, but never inherited any of their traits. Shukra-vaar, the day of his birth, is the name used for Friday in India. Shri Krishna declares Shukraachaarya as Ishvara\u2019s expression."

So if everything that we consider \u201cgood\u201d is Ishvara, its polar opposite is also Ishvara. To underscore this point, Shri Krishna brings forward gambling as Ishvara\u2019s manifestation.        Most of us are under the sway of maaya. If we let maaya have her way, she can steal our faculty of discrimination, our intellect that can distinguish right from wrong. Of all the possible ways of deluding and deceiving us, gambling is the strongest form of maaya. Like any addiction, it can cause great attachment and ultimately result in great sorrow. In the Srimad Bhaagavatam, the demon Kali was asked to reside wherever there is gambling.        Conversely, there are those among us who are endowed with a sharp intellect, one that never loses its power of discrimination. Nobel prize winners, freedom fighters, scientists, the list goes on. Shri Krishna says that it is Ishvara who is shining as the brilliance of such luminaries. Whenever we come across such individuals, we may feel inferior against their prowess. But there is no need to do so, because it is Ishvara that is giving them their brilliance.        Even if most of us are not endowed with such intellectual faculties, we can accomplish great things if we are hardworking, industrious and focused. People with very little mental and financial resources, through blood, sweat and tears, have shown that it is possible to succeed in spite of their limitations. Shri Krishna says that Ishvara manifests as their hard work, and also as the victory that comes as a result of this effort.        Sattva, along with rajas and tamas, comprise the three basic building blocks of maaya or prakriti. When any system is working in perfect harmony, without any fluctuations or disturbances, we can say that the Sattva quality has manifested. So when our intellect is functioning without any agitations, when we see things clearly, it indicates that sattva has dominated over rajas and tamas. Ishvara manifests as this sattva in people who demonstrate virtues such as modesty, calmness, sobriety and goodness."

Within the Saama Veda, there is a chant called the Brihat-Saama mantra, an invocation that is sung for praising Lord Indra. Since it is Brihat, the most potent and powerful among the Saama Veda mantras, Shri Krishna terms it as a foremost expression of Ishvara.        In prior chapters of the, we have seen the use of the poetic metre as a tool to emphasize the change in topic. Let us delve deeper into this. The Gita is composed in the \u201cAnushtup chandas\u201d . Chandas means metre. It is made up of 4 lines or padas, each comprising 8 syllables. For example, let us see a famous shloka: \u201cya-da-ya-da-hi-dharm-as-ya\u201d. It contains 8 syllables. There are 3 more lines like this. So we get 8 times 4 equals 32 syllables.        The Gaayatri mantra is considered to be the root and essence of all Vedic mantras. It is composed in a metre of the same name. The Gaayatri metre is made up of 4 lines each comprising 6 syllables. The first line is \u201ctat-sa-vi-tur-vareni-yam\u201d. Therefore the Gaayatri mantra as well as the associated metre, foremost among all the mantras, are Ishvara\u2019s expression.        Next, Shri Krishna elaborates upon weather and seasons. He says that among all the months, Ishvara is the month of Maargasheersha of the Indian calendar. It corresponds to the November-December time period and culminates in the festival of Makara Sankranti. He then goes on to say that among the seasons, Ishvara is Kusumaakara, which refers to spring, the flower-bearing season. Both Margasheersha and Kusumaakara are not too hot and not too cold. They are conducive to generating serenity in the mind, and that is why they are considered foremost expressions of Ishvara."

In order to remind us of the ephemeral nature of life, Shri Krishna says that among those forces that destroy things, Ishvara is death, the ultimate destroyer. Death is closely intertwined with time since everything is destroyed in the course of time.        In the Puranaas, Lord Shiva commences the act of dissolution by performing a dance called \u201ctaandava nritya\u201d, his drum called \u201cdamru\u201d in hand. After dissolution is complete, Ishvara then emerges as the creative principle to begin the next round of creation. Ishvara is the \u201cstuff\u201d of the universe, as well as the energy pervading it.        So far, we have come across several manifestations of Ishvara. At times, we may find hard to connect some of these manifestations because we are not familiar with them. Shri Krishna is careful to not alienate us. He now provides a list of qualities that we see in ourselves and in others every day.        These qualities are : keerti (name and fame on account of performing virtuous deeds), shree (beauty and wealth), vaak (refined speech), smiriti (memory of events), medhaa (ability to retain information that was read), dhriti (fortitude in the face of exhaustion) and kshama (forgiveness in the face of sorrow). In Sanskrit grammar these words are feminine nouns. Shri Krishna says that Ishvara manifests himself as one or all of these qualities in people."

Shri Krishna says that among the aksharas, the imperishable letters, Ishvara is manifested foremost in the letter \u201ca\u201d. No letter can be pronounced without the support of \u201ca\u201d. For example, the consonant \u201ck\u201d cannot be pronounced without adding an \u201ca\u201d to make it \u201cka\u201d. It is said that each letter has a presiding deity, and Lord Brahma is the presiding deity of \u201ca\u201d. Given its importance, it is Ishvara\u2019s manifestation.        Next, we delve into Sanskrit grammar. It has four types of compounds called avyavi, tatpurusha, bahuvreehee and dvandva. A compound joins two words. The dvandva compound gives equal importance to both words that are joined. For example: Raamalakshmanau is a dvandva compound. The other three compounds assign different levels of importance to the words that are joined. Since Dvandva, like Ishvara, maintains sameness between two objects, it is the foremost expression of Ishvara.        Previously, time was mentioned as the ultimate counter. Here, time is taken up in its infinite nature. It is that infinite time, \u201ckaala\u201d, which is prevalent before, during and after the creation of the universe. Ishvara, as the manifestation of infinite time, is the controller of Prakriti who is the provider of fruits of everyone\u2019s action. His omnipresence and omniscience, indicated by the phrase \u201cfacing all directions\u201d, ensures that everyone gets exactly what they deserve.         So whenever we read literature in both prose and poetry form, or when we contemplate the results of our actions, we should always realize that it is Ishvara working through all of them."

As Brahma, he creates the universe, as Vishnu he sustains the universe and as Shiva, he dissolves the universe. But Ishvara is ever present, he does not go away during any of these activities.        Next, Shri Krishna takes up the subject of knowledge. For most of us, knowledge refers either to academic knowledge, career-enhancing knowledge or knowledge about something we enjoy doing such as arts or literature. Although such knowledge has its place in our life, it is secondary or lower knowledge. It is \u201caparaa vidyaa\u201d.        Why is it secondary? Such knowledge keeps us engaged in the material world, in Prakriti or in Maaya. We tend to correct, change and rearrange our life situations, but none of these yield lasting happiness. We do not look to correcting the real problem, which is our understanding of our own self. Only spiritual knowledge, knowledge of our own self, has the power to take us out of the material world and towards Ishvara. This is why Shri Krishna praises \u201cadhyaatma vidyaa\u201d, spiritual knowledge among all types of knowledge.        We now come to the topic of debates. In all spheres of life, a conversation between two people where one is trying to influence other is extremely important. In the US, debates between two presidential candidates can make or break their chances of winning. In general, there are three kinds of debates.        In \u201cJalpa\u201d, the speaker wants to prove his point and bring down his opponent, no matter how sound or logical the opponent\u2019s argument. In \u201cVitanda\u201d, the speaker does not have any point to make, he just wants to bring down his opponent. Only in \u201cVaada\u201d do both speakers listen to each other and push each other to ensure that the most logical argument prevails, not that one or the other speaker wins. Shri Krishna says that such a debate that places logic above ego is Ishvara\u2019s foremost expression."

He says that wind is the foremost expression of Ishvara among all of the purifiers in the world. We know this from experience. Deep inhalation and exhalation removes several toxins from the body. If a room has been locked for a long time, the first thing we do is to open the window.        Lord Raama is also known as \u201cKodanda Paani\u201d, the wielder of weapons. Among all of the weapon wielders in the world, Lord Raama is the foremost. This is because although he was adept at wielding several types of weapons, he only used them as a last resort when no other methods of diplomacy worked. In the Raamayana, we can see numerous instances when he killed Rakshasaas after they did not heed his warning.        Now, just like we saw power and majesty in the Lion, we see power and majesty in the giant whale and the crocodile. \u201cMakara\u201d refers either to crocodile or the giant whale. Both of these are powerful sea creatures. Shri Krishna says that among the sea creatures, Ishvara\u2019s foremost expression is the Makara.        Among the rivers, Ishvara is Jaahnavi or Gangaa. Jaahnavi refers to the daughter of sage Jahnu. It is said that the Gangaa\u2019s turbulent waters disturbed the meditation of sage Jahnu. Angered, he drank her, and only released her when the gods prayed to him. Furthermore, knowledge, just like the river Gangaa, flows from a higher plane to a lower plane, and is perennial. Also, knowledge purifies, just like a river purifies.        So whenever we feel the wind, when we see weapons used justly, when we behold the giant whale or the mighty river, we should know that all these are Ishvara\u2019s manifestations."

Son of the demon-king Hiranyakashipu, he was an ardent devotee of Lord Naaraayana. So firm was his devotion that Lord Naaraayana appeared in the form of the half lion half man Narasimha to save Prahalaad from the atrocities committed by his father. Praising the strength of devotion, Shri Krishna says that Ishvara is found in Prahalaad among demons. Also, it drives home the message that we can change our destiny no matter what kind of family we are born into.        Next, Shri Krishna takes up the systems of counting. Even today there are various forms of such systems including the metric system, the imperial system and so on. The most accurate system, however, is that of time. Everything and everyone in the universe is under the influence of time and cannot escape its impact. So among the counting systems, Ishvara\u2019s foremost expression is that of time.        For those of us who have seen a lion up close, it is no surprise that Shri Krishna finds the lion as prominent among the animals. The king of the jungle is magnificent even if found in a cage. His roar subdues animals that are much larger than he is. Among the birds, it is Vainateya, also known as Garuda the eagle, who is Ishvara\u2019s finest expression. Garuda was the son of sage Kashyapa and Vinata. He is Lord Vishnu\u2019s mount, emanating the Vedas from his wings as he flies.        So whenever we see someone succeeding despite their weaknesses, when we observe the passage of time, whenever we see animals or birds, we should remember that everything is Ishvara only."

He is mentioned as part of the daily prayer ritual known as Sandhyavandanam. Symbolically, \u201cyaadas\u201d refers the to divinity prevalent in any seemingly inert object. Recognizing the divinity in everything, the Indian tradition encourages worship of the Tulsi leaf, of trees, of the earth and so on.        Pitra loka is the realm of the manes or ancestor gods. The seven primary manes are Kavyavaha, Anala, Soma, Yama, Aryama, Agnisvatta and Barhisat. Among these, Shri Krishna says that Ishvara is Aryaman, the chief of the manes. Ishvara is also Lord Yama among all the controllers. This is because he is also the lord of justice, using the ultimate punishment o death to maintain order and harmony in the universe."

Among the creative powers I am Kandarpa and among the snakes I am Vaasuki.        aayudhaanaam : among the weaponsaham : I amvajram : Vajradhenoonaam : among cowsasmi : I amkaamadhuk : Kaamadhenuprajanaha : among the creative powerscha : andasmi : I amkandarpaha : Kandarpasarpaanaam : among the snakesasmi : I amvaasukihi : Vaasuki        The Srimad Bhagavatam recounts the story of the demon Vritraasura who was created to kill all the deities. When their weapons were rendered powerless, they approached sage Dadhichi for help. Dadhichi, without any hesitation, offered to give his bones to the deities so that they could create Varja, the thunderbolt weapon of Lord Indra. Shri Krishna says that Ishvara is Vajra among the weapons, because it is powered by austerity and penance.        In the Puraanas, Kaamadhenu is a cow that has the ability to fulfill any desire that she is approached with. Even a normal cow has the ability to provide milk to a fanily in need, Symbolically, Kaamadhenu represents our mind because it can generate all kinds of thoughts, good or bad, out of thin air. Shri Krishna says that Ishvara expresses himself as Kaamadhenu.        Now, our mind has the ability to generate desires that prompt us to act. Kandarpa referes to Kaama deva, the lord of desire. Desires are the seed of creativity because without desire, there will be no creation. As we have seen so far, the Gita does not condemn desire as long as it falls within the purview of dharma or righteousness. So then, Ishvara manifests through those desires that are in line with dharma or righteousness.        Vaasuki is the king of snakes and is seen coiled around the neck of Lord Shiva. He symbolizes our ego or ahankaara, our sense of \u201cI\u201d. If we are able to tame our ego, then it becomes an ornament, as in the case of Lord Shiva. If we cannot tame it, it becomes dangerous and can strike us when we least expect it, by causing strong feeling of superiority or inferiority as an example. So Shri Krishna says that Vaasuki is Ishvara\u2019s expression among all the snakes.        So whenever we see someone devote their life towards a selfless cause, when our mind generates positive thoughts, when our desires are righteous and our ego is in check, we should realize that all this is Ishvara\u2019s expression."

The Puranaas describe the story of deities and demons churning the ocean for gaining the nectar of immortality. Before the nectar came out, several other divine entities emerged and Ucchaihshrava, the divine horse, was one of them. \u201cUchhai\u201d means great and shravas means prosperity. Symbolically, Ucchaihshrava stands for the prosperity we attain when we put in focused effort and renounce our material desires. Shri Krishna says that among all the horses, the divine Ucchaihshrava is Ishvara\u2019s expression.        Airaavata is a four-tusked white elephant who is the mount of Indra, king of the deities. He is credited with showering rain. His mother is Iravati, grand daughter of sage Kashyapa. Given his status, Shri Krishna says that among all the elephants, Airaavata is Ishvara\u2019s expression.        Next, Shri Krishna turns to more familiar grounds by referencing humans. Among human beings, he says that Ishvara expresses in the leader. But this is not just any ordinary leader. Ishvara expresses himself in leaders whose accomplishments are a product of their hard work and effort, and whose leadership is in line with dharma or righteousness. It is easy to get name and fame by virtue of association or by performing unrighteous acts. This is not the leader that is referenced here.        So whenever we see the result of hard work, a humanitarian leader, or the cooling rain that parches a dry land, we should remember that all these are Ishvara\u2019s expressions."

The Peepul tree, as it is more commonly known, is used to symbolically describe the human condition in the 15th chapter of the Gita. In India, women traditionally worship this tree for obtaining a good husband. In general, trees are given the status of saints in India. Like saints, trees always give back more to the world than they take.        We had already encountered Sage Naarada earlier in this chapter. Shri Krishna references Gandharvas next. Gandharvas are celestial beings who are accomplished singers, musicians and dancers. Among these, he considers Chitraratha foremost, and a manifestation of Ishvara. The word Chitraratha means one who has a wonderful chariot. In the Mahabhaarata, Chitraratha taught the fine arts to Arjuna, and advised the Paandavas to appoint a sage to guide them.        We now come to the notion of \u201csiddhis\u201d. A siddhi is a superhuman power. Most people are drawn to sages who demonstrate superhuman powers. But just because someone has superhuman powers does not necessarily mean that he has achieved liberation. Sage Kapila was one of those rare individuals who not only had superhuman powers but also had achieved liberation. He is credited as the originator of the Saankhya school of philosophy. he also delivered a sermon to his mother which is known as the Kapila Gita."

Bhrigu is one of the seven sages or the Sapta Rishis that were willed into existence by Lord Brahma at the beginning of creation.        It is said that Bhrigu wanted to test who is the most patient among the holy trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Bhrigu tested Brahma and Shiva and was not pleased. When he went to visit Vishnu, Vishnu was taking a nap and did not notice Bhrigu enter. Angry with this, Bhrigu kicked Vishnu on the chest. Vishnu woke up from his nap and asked Bhrigu whether his foot was hurt, instead of getting angry at just been kicked. Bhrigu then decided that Vishnu was the most patient among the trinity.        Next, Shri Krishna says that among all the utterances or spoken words, the word Om, made up of just one letter, is the foremost. The entire Mandukya Upanishad describes the glory of the word Om in great detail, and uses Om as a method to achieve liberation.        In Indian culture, there are several rituals for appeasing various deities. Shri Krishna says that the act of chanting a mantra, also known as japa, is the foremost ritual possible. This is because most other rituals require wealth for procurement of materials, lot of time as well as knowledge of the right procedures and mantras. The ritual of japa is easy because it does not have such requirements. It can also be performed by someone who may not be physically fit or bedridden.        The Himalayas, the \u201cabode of snow\u201d, is the highest and most massive mountain system in the world. It comprises a 2400 km span of land with peaks ranging as high as 8000 metres. Shri Krishna says that among the immobile objects in the world, the Himalayas are the most prominent manifestation of Ishvara."

Brihaspati is described in the Puraanaas as the \u201cpurodha\u201d or guru of Indra, who is the king of all the deities. He was the son of Sage Angiras, one of the seven original rishis or Sapta-Rishis. His counterpart in the world of the demons or Asuras was Sage Shukrachaarya.        Next, Shri Krishna says that Isvara is expressed through Skanda, the most powerful army commander in the world. Skanda, also known as Kaartikeya, is the son of Lord Shiva. He is described as having six faces and twelve arms. When the army of the deities began the war to kill the asura named Taraka, a celestial voice proclaimed that victory could be possible only if Skanda was made army commander.        The earth is filled with several water bodies, ranging from tiny rain puddles to lakes that are visible from outer space. But the most expansive body of water is the ocean. Some estimates suggest that there is 1260 million trillion litres of water on planet earth. On average, the ocean is around 1 kilometer deep and can go to 11 kilometers in some places. The ocean sustains life on this earth and is home to thousands of species. This vast and awe-inspiring ocean is one of the most powerful expressions of Ishvara.        With this in mind, we should be able to see Ishvara in our teachers, in military prowess used for just means, and when we drink water."

He says that among the deities known as Rudras, he is Lord Shiva, the foremost among them. Rudras are deities that have been mentioned since Vedic times. Their name is derived from the rood \u201crud\u201d which means to cry or howl. They symbolically represent the vital life energies, and therefore make people cry when they leave the body.        It is said that there are eleven Rudras: Hara, Bahuroopa, Trayambaka, Aparaajita, Vrishaakapi, Shambhu (Lord Shiva), Kapardin, Raivata, Mrigavyaadha, Shaarva and Kapaalin. Shri Krishna says that Lord Shiva is Ishvara\u2019s expression because he is the calmest among them, and brings joy to his devotees.        Among the demigods known as the Yakshas and Rakshasaas, Ishvara is Vittesha who is also known as Kubera. Vitta means wealth, so Kubera is considered the lord of wealth. He is worshipped during the Lakshmi Pooja festival. Among the eight Vasus, deities who represent the elemental forces, Ishvara\u2019s expression is fire because it is the greatest purifier.        Next, Shri Krishna says that among the mountain peaks, Ishvara is the mountain known as Meru. It is considered the most prominent mountain and the centre of the universe in the Srimad Bhaagavatam, hence it is Ishvara\u2019s expression. The human spinal column is also known as \u201cMeru danda\u201d or the Meru rod, and the primary bead in a rosary is known as the Meru bead.        Whenever we see fire, mountains, wealth, or someone in sorrow due to punishment, we should remember Ishvara through his expressions of fire, Kubera, mount Meru and Lord Shiva."

Each Veda has a unique characteristic. The Yajur Veda contains prose, the Rig Veda contains metric hymns, the Saama Veda contains songs and the Atharva Veda contains incantations. Of these, the Saama Veda is Ishvara\u2019s expression, indicating his preference for music.        Among all the deities, Ishvara is the king of all deities known as Vaasava, also known as Indra. While our attention usually falls on the excesses of wealth and power that kings demonstrate, this was not the case traditionally. A king is supposed to spend every minute of his life serving his subjects, sacrificing everything. Such a rules of deities is a true expressions of Ishvara.        As we have seen earlier, we transact or interact with the world with our body, our senses, our organs of action, our mind and our intellect. The five senses and the five organs of action would be useless if not for the mind, that collects information from the senses and pulls together a complete picture of the world for us. It also instructs our organs to move, based on the inputs it receives. Shri Krishna says that this mind is an expression of Ishvara.        If we were to be born as a plant, animal or human, we would undoubtedly prefer to be born as a human. The key difference between a human and a plant or animal is the capacity of intelligence that lets us think logically, display compassion towards others, plan for the future and most importantly, pursue the path of the higher self. This wonderful intelligence in is is also Ishvara\u2019s expression.        So therefore, if our mind generates thoughts of compassion or service, if our intellect makes us acts upon these thoughts so that we can serve others, we should remember that it is not the \u201cI\u201d in us that is causing everything to happen. It is all happening through Ishvara and his expressions."

He begins by saying that among the Aadityaas or the sons of Aditi, he is Vishnu. The twelve sons of Aditi were Dhaataa, Mitra, Aryamaa, Rudra, Varuna, Soorya, Bhaga, Vivasvaan, Poosha, Savitaa, Tvashtaa and Vishnu. Vishnu also refers to the Vaamana avatar.        Next, Shri Krishna says that Ishvara is \u201cRavi\u201d, the sun, among all the bright objects in the universe. He uses the word \u201canshumaan\u201d meaning radiant to describe the sun. So whenever we see the brilliance of the sun, our mind should immediately go towards the might of Ishvara that is shining through the sun. And just like Ishvara\u2019s luminosity is present in the sun during the day, it is present in the moon during the night.        There is an episode in the Sunder Kand of the Tulsi Ramayana where Lord Hanumaan was captured bound with ropes in Lanka. It is said that there are forty nine types of wind deities known as Marutas. Hanumaan was the son of the lord of wind, Vayu. When all forty nine types of winds began to blow, he untied himself of all the ropes and flew from building to building, burning each one with his flaming tail. Shri Krishna says that Mareechi, the prominent among the Marutas, is Ishvara\u2019s expression.        With these expressions in our mind, we will never be disconnected from Ishvara. In the day, we can look at the sun \u2013 it is Ishvara. When the winds blow, it is Ishvara. In the night, the moon is Ishvara."

He lists the two most important ones first. He says that Ishvara is the self, the \u201cI\u201d that is in the hearts of every being in the universe. Ishvara is also the start, middle and end of all beings in the universe.        So what exactly does \u201cself\u201d mean? Let us try to understand its opposite meaning first. When we treat a thing or a person as something different from us, something external to us, then we are creating a subject-object relationship where the subject is our \u201cI\u201d and the object is \u201chim\u201d or \u201cher\u201d.         For instance, if we take an acquaintance out to dinner, for example, we may ask him to pay his bill separately. There is a sense of separateness between us and the acquaintance. Separating, externalizing, objectifying \u2013 all this is the opposite of self-hood.        But if we take our spouse or our child to dinner, we don\u2019t even think twice to pay for their dinner. This is because we do not consider a spouse or a child different or external to us. The sense of self-hood is greater here than with a stranger or with an acquaintance. Shri Krishna says that when this sense of selfhood expresses itself in our hearts, we should know that it is Ishvara\u2019s primary expression. If we can remember this constantly, if we can treat everything and every one as no different than ourselves, we do not have to remember any other expression of Ishvara. We are done.        So what is the practical implication of understanding Ishvara in this manner? Our sense of I-ness and my-ness automatically drops. There will be nothing in us that asserts \u201cmy will\u201d, \u201cmy plan\u201d, \u201cmy thinking\u201d, \u201cI am going to do this\u201d and so on. It will all become Ishvara\u2019s will, Ishvara\u2019s plan, Ishvara\u2019s thinking, Ishvara\u2019s doing. All worries and anxieties will disappear because the \u201cI\u201d who worries is no longer present.        If we are not able to comprehend Ishvara as our own self, then Shri Krishna provides another expression of Ishvara. He says that we should think of Ishvara as the one who creates, sustains and dissolves all the names and forms in the universe, just like the ocean creates, sustains and dissolves all waves. If we can think in this manner, Ishvara becomes all-pervading, ever present at all times.        Now, thinking Ishvara as the self, or as the beginning, middle and end of all beings, is difficult when we are beginners. For most of us, it is easier to see Ishvara in tangible people and objects. We will see those types of expressions in the following shlokas."

Shri Krishna, delighted with Arjuna\u2019s request, replied by saying \u201chanta\u201d. The word hanta has three meanings. It is used to express excitement, wonder or dejection. In this context, Shri Krishna was happy and eager to speak about Ishvara\u2019s glories, so the meaning here is with regards to excitement.        Let us go back to our electricity example. There are thousands upon thousands of objects that use electricity. It is impossible to enumerate all of them. But it is possible to list those objects that are mighty, powerful, or have the capacity to elicit wonder and awe. Similarly, Shri Krishna admitted that though it would not be possible to list all of Ishvara\u2019s glories and expressions because they are infinite. However, he would be able to list the most significant ones.        As we go through the list of Ishvara\u2019s expressions in the upcoming shlokas, we may tend to get carried away by the richness of the stories, the mythology, the history and so on. While that is good and has its place, let us not forget the main point, which is to keep our mind established in the thought that \u201cIshvara is in everything\u201d."

But this time, he would not be content with hearing so little. He requested Shri Krishna to give a detailed and elaborate description of Ishvara\u2019s expressions as well as yoga, the power of maaya that creates many expressions of the one Ishvara.        Arjuna addressed Shri Krishna as \u201cJanaardana\u201d which has two meanings. \u201cArda\u201d means one who moves, or makes others move. Jana means people, and therefore Janaardana means one who moves people to heaven or hell, in other words, dispenses justice to evildoers. Another meaning of Janaardana is one whom people ask for prosperity and well being. Arjuna understood that the true nature of Shri Krishna was Ishvara.        With this shloka, Shri Krishna concluded his statements and requests. Starting with the next shloka, Shri Krishna will provide a total of 72 vibhootis or expressions of Ishvara. Most of these are drawn from the Indian Vedic and Puraanic tradition since Arjuna would be easily able to identify with and connect with those examples. We can try to look for similarities in the present time so that we are also able to connect with those."

He wanted to know the technique by which he could constantly be reminded of Ishvara, and consequently, remain established in the contemplation of Ishvara. That is why in this shloka, Arjuna asked Shri Krishna to reveal more of his expressions.        When we wake up in the morning, we probably get five to ten minutes, at most, of a calm mind. Then, when our daily routine starts, our mind takes over and we are pulled into a rollercoaster ride of worry and sorrow. In the midst of all this it is difficult to bring in a divine thought for a minute, let alone contemplate on Ishvara constantly. Addressing Shri Krishna as Yogin, one who has the power of sovereignty, Arjuna asked him for a solution to overcome this predicament.        Furthermore, if we were told once that Ishvara is the cause of everything, and we are able to hold on to that fact, we need not have to worry about forgetting Ishvara. But because of our conditioning that has built up over a long period of time, and because of our ego \u2013 our sense that \u201cI do everything\u201d \u2013 is so strong, we need more support to counter that conditioning. We need a step-by-step approach, a list of Ishvara\u2019s expressions, just like kids have to be told that a TV, a radio, a computer, all operate using electricity.        Now, if such a list of Ishvara\u2019s expressions is needed, it cannot be terse and brief. It needs to be detailed. This is what Arjuna requests in the next shloka."

To that end, he acknowledges that Ishvara is part and parcel of the universe by saying that Ishvara has established himself by pervading the entire universe with his manifestations and expressions. It is like saying that the Internet, by pervading our every activity, has established itself in ourlife.        With this realization, Arjuna begins to request Shri Krishna to give him a detailed understanding of Ishvara\u2019s expressions. Since Ishvara is the origin, the first cause, only Ishvara in the form of Shri Krishna is capable or competent to reveal his true nature to Arjuna.        For example, only a really old person who was alive during the Indian freedom struggle can reveal details to us that we may never hear about or read about anywhere else. Similarly, only Ishvara can reveal his divine opulence and glories. It is said that the Vedas, also known as \u201cshruti\u201d, are the mouthpiece of Ishvara. The Gita has been derived from the Vedas.        Arjuna, having praised Ishvara, now begins asking his question in the next shloka."

But, being eager to still know Ishvara, he began using several words to describe Ishvara in this shloka. He also acknowledges that only Ishvara can know Ishvara, since there was nothing prior to Ishvara. Ishvara is self-evident, just like we do not need another source of light to see the sun.        Arjuna addressed Ishvara as \u201cpurushottama\u201d, the foremost and eminent person, beyond all cause and effect. He is \u201cbhootabhaavana\u201d, the origin of all beings, the absolute reality that has taken maaya as an upaadhi or qualifier to create this world of names and forms. He is also \u201cbhootesha\u201d, the master and lord of all beings.        Even though he is the controller, he is not someone who is a cruel master. He is \u201cdevadeva\u201d, the lord of all deities including Indra and Varuna, someone who is revered and adored. Also, Ishvara does not quit once the world is created. He is also \u201cjagatpate\u201d, the protector and nourisher of the universe. However, we need to understand that, like a magician, Ishvara is never affected by the magic show. He is the cause, and the magic show of the universe is the effect.        So, if Ishvara can alone know Ishvara, only Ishvara can reveal his glories. Arjuna takes this up next."

With this shloka, Arjuna acknowledges that he has completely understood the true nature of Ishvara since the knowledge is coming from the source, from Ishvara himself.        It is interesting to note the use of the name \u201cKeshava\u201d to refer to Shri Krishna. \u201cKa\u201d represents Lord Brahma and \u201cIsha\u201d represents Lord Shiva. So Keshava is the one who harmonizes the powers of creation and destruction. In other words, Ishvara creates, sustains and dissolves the universe of names and forms.        Since Ishvara is the origin of everything, Arjuna says that no deity, human or demon can claim to know Ishvara in totality because Ishvara came before any of them. Another interpretation of this statement is that no sense organ such as the eye or ear can claim to know Ishvara. Unlike worldly knowledge about objects, the knowledge of Ishvara can only be known as a subject. Tulsidas says this poetically in the Tulsi Ramayana : \u201cJaanat tumahi tumahi hui jaayi\u201d. One who knows you becomes you. All sense of individuality, the sense of I, the subject, goes away when one merges into Ishvara.        So then, if no deity, human or demon can know Ishvara, who can? Arjuna gives the answer in the next shloka."

He listed the names of the renowned sages Naarada, Asita, Devala and Vyaasa in this regard.        The Srimad Bhagavatam speaks of Naarada as the son of a maid-servant who served several priests. He grew up in an environment of spirituality and decided to seek the absolute truth in a forests after his mother passed away. His meditation bore fruit when he had a vision of Ishvara. After his death, he was reborn as the sage Naarada that many of us are familiar with. Naarada was learned in all the arts and sciences. He could travel anywhere in the universe, and talk to any deity that he wished.        Another sage mentioned here is Devalaha who was the son of a great sage named Asita, who was born as a result of Asita\u2019s prayer to Lord Shiva. It is said that Devalaha was cursed by a celestial maiden named Rambha for not agreeing to marry her. He was reborn as Sage Ashtavakra, who is famous for writing the Ashtavakra Gita. And of course, Sage Krishna Dvaipayana Vyaasa is the author of the great Indian epic Mahabhaarata.        So therefore, Arjuna accepted the authority of Shri Krishna to convey the true nature of Ishvara. But did he have any doubts or objections?"

This understanding prompted him to praise Ishvara, and that is what we will see in the next few shlokas.        Arjuna spoke of Ishvara as \u201cparama brahman\u201d which is the absolute reality, the eternal essence that was spoken of in the second chapter. He understood that Ishvara\u2019s real nature is beyond time and space, it is that which is the support of time and space. Ishvara is\u201dparama dhaaman\u201d, the supreme goal, the ultimate abode of all beings. Ishvara is also the supreme purifier, as he destroys all traces of impurities in the form of ignorance.        The word \u201cpurusha\u201d literally means, one who fills the body. Ishvara is the \u201cdivyam shaashvatam purusha\u201d, the divine eternal person the comprises the entire universe, just like all of the cells in our body are termed as \u201cbody\u201d in aggregate. Ishvara is divine because he is beyond the realm of impermanence caused by maaya. He is \u201cajam\u201d, beyond birth, but is the cause of everyone else\u2019s birth. He is \u201cvibhum\u201d which is all-pervading, he alone appears as everything.        Like the Vishnu Sahasranaam that enumerates a thousand names of Ishvara, this shloka can be used as a prayer to meditate upon Ishvara\u2019s glories. Now, did only Arjuna think that this was the real nature of Ishvara or did others as well? Arjuna takes this up in the next shloka."

Like a lamp that is lit to dispel darkness, Ishvara, out of sheer compassion, ignites the yoga of intellect which removes ignorance from the hearts of serious devotees.        The renowned Shankaraachaarya has elaborated upon this illustration in his Gita commentary. His illustration is comprised of the lamp with a lamp holder, wick, and oil. The lamp holder is the quality of vairagya or dispassion, the wick is brahmacharya or continence and the oil is prasaada buddhi or the willingness to accept everything in life as Ishvara\u2019s blessing. The lamp is nourished by a gentle breeze in the form of constant devotion to Ishvara, but can be extinguished by an impure mind containing strong likes and dislikes.        With these two shlokas, Shri Krishna summarizes the path of the bhakti marga or devotional means to attain Ishvara. In bhakti, Ishvara\u2019s grace is emphasized rather than individual effort. In the Indian tradition this is pictorially depicted by comparing a monkey with a cat. In \u201cmarkatanyaaya\u201d, the method of the monkey, a baby monkey has to hang on to its mother with its own effort. But in \u201cmarjalanyaaya\u201d, the method of the cat, a kitten does not have to do anything because its mother holds her by its neck.        Likewise, Ishvara takes care of his devotees. He will ensure that their material needs are taken care of. But more importantly, he will ensure that all our ignorance is destroyed and that we are educated spiritually. This is in contrast with other paths to Ishvara that require significant self effort. There is no need to roll any beads or sit in any postures. All that is required is surrender.        With these words, Shri Krishna stopped speaking and Arjuna, excited by the topic, started praising him."

Such a high degree of \u201cpreetipurvaka bhajan\u201d or worship with joy and devotion can only yield a wonderful result. Those who display such ardent devotion as termed \u201csataya yuktaanam\u201d by Shri Krishna because they are constantly connected to Ishvara. He says that Ishvara rewards such devotees with \u201cbuddhi yoga\u201d, a superior form of intellect and understanding.        Typically, we would have expected Ishvara to reward his ardent devotees with material prosperity. This is a given, since we have already heard Shri Krishna say that Ishvara will carry the material burden of his devotees in the previous chapter. But that is a lower form of blessing or reward. The highest type of blessing that can be given to a devotee is not material, it is intellectual. No object, wealth, social status or possession can stand in front of the knowledge of the true nature of things.        What is the result of this intellectual understanding? It is the ability to see Ishvara in everything, and everything in Ishvara. If someone tells us that the necklace we had lost is actually around our neck, we do not have to do anything or go anywhere in order to find it. We know where to look for it. Similarly, this vision given to us by Ishvara enables us to see him everywhere and in everything. It is the vision of equanimity mentioned in the sixth chapter.        So then, what is the main obstacle that Ishvara removes with this knowledge? Shri Krishna explains in the next shloka."

He says that their minds are always absorbed in contemplating Ishvara and their entire lives are submitted in extolling the virtues of Ishvara. This gives them an eternal source of joy and contentment.        The Swiss are known for running their trains with near-perfect precision. If the train has to leave the platform at 9:30 am, it will leave the station not one second earlier or later. So whenever we have to board a train in Switzerland, there will never be a doubt in our mind as to whether the train will be on time or not. Our faith in the precision of their train system is unshakeable.        Similarly, when we our faith in Ishvara becomes firm, we do not go running towards other sources of joy in the world. We recognize that the universe operates under Ishvara\u2019s laws, and that any pleasant or unpleasant situations that we encounter are a result of our prior actions. They are not random or arbitrary. Our likes and dislikes will slowly thin down. We will take every situation as a learning experience and keep our focus on Ishvara.        Shri Krishna says that when devotees gain such a strong faith and conviction in Ishvara, they do not think about anything else. Like cricket fans who eat, sleep, breathe and talk about cricket, the devotees converse about Ishvara, educate each other about Ishvara and dedicate their mind and senses to Ishvara.        Why do they do this? They only find contentment and joy in Ishvara since they do not need to run towards material objects for happiness. They revel in Ishvara. This is the difference between an ordinary seeker and a serious seeker. An ordinary seeker is interested in Ishvara \u201calso\u201d, whereas a serious seeker is interested in Ishvara \u201conly\u201d.

Those who have established themselves in this yoga are \u201cbudhaa\u201d, they are wise. They only worship or contemplate upon Ishvara, remaining unaffected by the ups and downs in life.        Imagine an adult and a child walking inside a haunted house within an amusement park. Though both of them see and hear the same things, they have different reactions.

So enjoys the thrill of the haunted house without being afraid.        The difference between the adult and the child is that the adult has knowledge about the cause of the ghosts and the noises. Similarly, Shri Krishna says that one who knows Ishvara as the cause of everything will develop an extremely positive attitude towards life. He will take failures as learning opportunities, not as triggers for depression. He will never question why something bad happened to him, knowing that it is a result of his prior actions.

Shri Krishna says that one who is able to perceive Ishvara as manifesting through expressions becomes established in \u201cavikampena yoga\u201d or a constant, unshakeable connection with Ishvara.        Vibhooti refers to the multiple or pluralistic manifestation of Ishvara, the presence of Ishvara in all forms present in the universe. Yoga, also known as yoga-maaya, is the power that makes this pluralistic manifestation possible. Shri Krishna says that one who knows this vibhooti and yoga as arising from Ishvara is constantly united with Ishvara.        The key here is to develop a vision that goes into the essence of any object or person or situation instead of getting distracted by the form, just like a scrap metal dealer\u2019s vision goes straight into the metal, and not the shape.        How do we develop this vision? Let us bring back the concept of material cause and intelligent cause that we saw earlier. A pot is created by two aspects: the material cause which is clay, and the intelligent cause which is the potter. So for instance, when Shri Krishna said that the seven sages were created by Ishvara, it means that Ishvara is both the \u201cstuff\u201d and the \u201csculptor\u201d. He is both the material and intelligent cause of those sages. The Mundaka Upanishad illustrates this concept with the example of a spider who creates a web from his own body, using no other external raw material. The spider becomes the material cause and the intelligent cause of the web.        So if our thoughts are made of Ishvara, objects are made of Ishvara, situations are made of Ishvara, if we develop this vision, what will happen to us? We will get established in an unshakeable, unwavering connection with Ishvara. In other words, if we know that Ishvara is present in everything, we will never be disconnected from Ishvara, just like our cell phones are never disconnected from their network no matter which part of the country we visit. We will we able to encounter every situation in life with poise and equanimity, without being shaken up, because everything is ultimately Ishvara.        This state of unwavering yoga is elaborated upon in the next shloka."

He now enumerates Ishvara\u2019s manifest, visible expressions. Per tradition, the entire universe was created by seven great sages and fourteen individuals known as \u201cManus\u201d. Shri Krishna asserts that these sages and Manus, the creators of all living and inert beings in this universe, were themselves created by Ishvara through his mind.        The Srimad Bhagavatam described the creation of the universe in great detail. Ishvara first created Lord Brahma and entrusted him with the responsibility of creating the universe. Lord Brahma then created the four child-sages Sanaka, Sanandana, Sanaatana and Sanatkumaara. When he asked them to populate the world, they refused, because they did not want to get tangled in any material pursuits. They took the vow of celibacy and roamed the world, constantly contemplating upon Ishvara.        Next, Lord Brahma created the saptarishis or the seven great sages Bhrigu, Marichi, Atri, Pulastya, Pulaha, Kratuhu and Vasishtha. He then created Manu was who was entrusted with further procreation and establishment of the moral code, which is known as Manusmriti. There are fourteen Manus that correspond to fourteen Manvantaras or periods of Manu.        Having enumerated the creators of his universe, Shri Krishna says that all those original individuals are expressions that were created from Ishvara\u2019s mind, just like we create whole new worlds in our dreams in a matter of seconds without any external materials. This shloka is similar to the biblical verse \u201cLet there be light\u201d. The idea is the same \u2013 that Ishvara is the original cause of everything.

He begins with the description of \u201cahimsaa\u201d or non-injury. Non-injury typically is understood as refraining from physically hurting a living being. But more broadly, it means refraining from depriving someone else of happiness, knowledge and finitude. For instance, if we cheat someone or we insult someone, we are not practising non-injury.        Next is \u201csamataa\u201d or equanimity. The second chapter speaks elaborately on the quality of equanimity or balance as paramount to the performance of karma yoga. If external factors such as heat, cold, praise and censure destabilize our mind, it means that our ego is attached to those factors and disturbs the balance of our mind. Maintaining equanimity in such situations is a sign of healthy detachment and dispassion.        \u201cTushtihi\u201d or contentment refers to \u201cprasaada buddhi\u201d, or the ability to accept everything in life, good or bad, joyful or sorrowful, as a gift from Ishvara. If we are constantly unhappy with what life gives us, we are failing to recognize the infinitude of our eternal essence, and are instead attached to our limited, finite ego.        \u201cTapaha\u201d or penance refers to the energy that builds up in our body when we practice restraint of our sense organs. For example, if we refrain for talking for a day, that energy is conserved within our body and generates heat which is known as \u201ctapas\u201d. \u201cDaanam\u201d or charity refers to donating or distributing our wealth so that we do not get into the practice of hoarding.        \u201cYasha\u201d is the fame that comes through pursuit of dharma or lawful conduct, and \u201cayashaha\u201d is the infamy that results through the pursuit of adharma or unlawful conduct.        Shri Krishna concludes this topic by asserting that all of these qualities are generated in us by none other than Ishvara. However, there is a set of rules that govern the creation of these qualities. It does not happen randomly or in an ad-hoc manner. It is our karma or actions that determine which qualities or states will arise within us. If we constantly surround ourselves with good company, we will automatically imbibe good qualities and vice versa.        So far, Shri Krishna has described Ishvara\u2019s subtle expressions. We now will being to see Ishvara\u2019s tangible, visible expressions starting from the next shloka."

He says that intelligence, wisdom, non-delusion, forgiveness, self-restraint, joy and sorrow, creation and destruction, fear and fearlessness, all of these are expressions of Ishvara. Whenever we come across any of these expressions, we should immediately realize that it is Ishvara expressing himself through them.        \u201cBuddhihi\u201d or intellect is the ability to know subtle things, things that are not immediately perceived by our senses. Our tongue may enjoy fried food, but our intellect will tell us not to indulge in it due to the potential health risks. Now, none of our senses saw something called a \u201chealth risk\u201d but our intellect did. Similarly, \u201cjnyaana\u201d or wisdom is the ability to discriminate between the eternal essence and everything else. Engaging with the world without getting deluded into thinking that it is the source of happiness, this is \u201casammoha\u201d or non-delusion.        With the foundation of intellect, wisdom and non-delusion, we are ready to engage with the world. We may encounter people that speak ill of us or trouble us in some way. \u201cKshamaa\u201d or forgiveness lets us drop any negative thinking that is generated out of such interactions. Conversely, it is our duty to convey to others what we perceive of the world without adding any modifications or distortions. This is known as \u201csatyam\u201d or truthfulness. We may also encounter people, objects and situations that generate selfish desires within us. In order to guard against chasing after them, we need to cultivate \u201cdama\u201d or sense control, and \u201cshama\u201d which is control over the mind.        Now, let us examine Ishvara\u2019s manifestations that come in pairs. We usually tend to be attracted towards one aspect of the pair and run away from the other aspect. First let us look at \u201csukham\u201d and \u201cduhkham\u201d or joy and sorrow. We prefer joyful situations and tend to avoid sorrowful ones. We prefer \u201cbhaavaha\u201d or creation but dislike \u201cabhaavaha\u201d or destruction. We like to be \u201cabhaya\u201d or fearless, not \u201cbhaya\u201d or fearlessness.        Shri Krishna wants us to remain equanimous, remain balanced in both aspects of these pairs. Ishvara may send a sorrowful situation in order to create further vairagya or dispassion. Like a municipality that demolishes a dangerously unlivable building, he may destroy a person, object or situation so that a new one can be created in its place. Like a robber who is afraid of a burglary alarm, he may generate fear in us so that we do not commit an unlawful or unethical act.        The second part of this topic is covered in the next shloka."

Also, he is freed from all his sins. This is the end result of devotion.        The Gita places special emphasis on the quality of viveka or discrimination. It is the ability to differentiate between what is real and what is unreal. For some people, this comes easily but for most of us, it does not. Devotion is the solution. When we begin to hear about Ishvara\u2019s glories, our vision and understanding about his true nature increases. We begin to realize that while everything in the world has a beginning and end, Ishvara is beyond time. We begin to see that he is everywhere, he is not confined to a certain space or location.        So when we see that Ishvara is present everywhere and everytime, beyond the realm of time and space, we automatically begin to understand that everything else is finite and transient. Our reactions to situations become calmer. If we come across a tough situation, we know that the timeless ever present Ishvara is in there, and so therefore the situation will be temporary and will not bother us anymore. We become \u201cassammodaha\u201d or wise, beyond all delusion.        Also, by hearing these glories, we realize that Ishvara is the one who is running the universe. When we identify ourselves with the controller of the universe, our ego, sense of doership and enjoyership automatically drops because we know that we are doing nothing, it is all Ishvara\u2019s doing. When the sinner, which is nothing the sense of doership and enjoyership, is dropped, all our sins are destroyed in an instant.        Shri Krishna now beings to speak of Ishvara\u2019s expressions, which is the main theme of this chapter. He first speaks about Ishvara\u2019s inner, subtle expressions in the next few shlokas. He later speaks about his external, more visible expressions."

Now, why should that be the case? Why can\u2019t someone else talk about Ishvara\u2019s glories? It is because Ishvara is the cause of everything in this entire universe. He is the \u201caadihi\u201d or the first principle. He is the ultimate cause.        As we have seen earlier, most of us have an idea that a certain deity is almighty and all-powerful. But ultimately, all those gods and deities are emissaries of Ishvara. They came into existence much later than Ishvara. Similarly, great sages and wise people have also come into existence after Ishvara. Therefore, none of these individuals has the ability to clearly fathom the real nature of Ishvara.        For instance, imagine that you want to learn the history of a large corporation. You may research internet sites, you can talk to the current employees, you can even track down the original employees, but the only person who knows the entire history will be the company\u2019s founder. He can reveal details that only he knew at the time of founding the company. No one else can know these details.        So then, if Ishvara is the ultimate cause of the universe, then everything in the universe is an effect of that ultimate cause. An effect can never know its cause in totality. Therefore, the most qualified person to expound the glories himself is Ishvara himself, speaking through the form of Shri Krishna. Such a teaching is called \u201capaurusheya\u201d. It is not authored by a human, it has come from Ishvara directly.        As we hear more about the glories of Ishvara, we will need to delve deeper into what is meant by the term \u201cultimate cause\u201d. To prepare for this exploration, picture a potter creating a pot. There are two main ingredients that go into the pot. One is clay, the substance of which the pot is made. The other is the intelligence of the potter that decides the shape and the method to create it.        With this picture in mind, let us remember four things that will help us in understanding Ishvara. The pot is an effect. The pot has come from a cause. The \u201cmaterial cause\u201d of the pot is clay. The intelligence, also known as the \u201cefficient cause\u201d, is the potter. We will recall this example later in the chapter.        So then, what is the gain of learning about Ishvara and his glories? Shri Krishna explains this next."

He continued speaking because Arjuna was taking delight in the teaching. Good teachers know when to take questions and when to continue teaching so that the student is engaged and encouraged.        This chapter of the Gita is known as \u201cVibhooti Yoga\u201d. It continues the theme of the seventh and ninth chapters by listing several vibhootis or expressions of Ishvara. Why are expressions important? Consider electricity which is invisible to our senses but is a source of great power. If we wish to learn more about electricity by watching a power outlet or a power line, we may not be able to understand electricity that much. But if we see a bright and colourful lamp, or medical equipment that helps save people\u2019s lives, it is easier to appreciate the glory of electricity.        Ishvara is infinitely powerful than electricity but is also invisible and unknown to our senses. Only through knowing his expressions can we become aware of his presence, and gradually expand our vision to see the one Ishvara in everything. Shri Krishna is concerned with Arjuna\u2019s well-being, so in that regard he wanted to reveal Ishvara\u2019s glories to Arjuna. He calls these glories \u201cparamam\u201d or supreme because they enable us to transcend this world of name and form and access Ishvara.        Why is Ishvara invisible and unknown to our senses, and to other beings in the universe? This is explained next."

        "content": "In the previous chapter, Shri Krishna described the endless cycle of creation and dissolution of the universe, and how all beings are stuck in that cycle. In this chapter, he began to reveal an extremely profound and secret knowledge to Arjuna that would allow him to escape this endless cycle. That knowledge is devotion or bhakti towards Ishvara. It is the easiest means of obtaining liberation, easier than than performing rituals or penance or renouncing the world.        What is this knowledge? Ishvara is the ultimate cause of the universe. Everything is sustained by Ishvara. Everything is in Ishvara, like the wind is in space. We are not able to see Ishvara because our senses are preconditioned to only perceive names and forms, just like we see a blue sky where there is no real blue colour.        Ishvara becomes the ultimate cause of the universe through his power known as Prakriti. Through this power, he creates the world of names and forms, sustains them and eventually dissolves them. Prakriti is nothing but the three gunas. It is a fully automatic system that delivers results to individuals based on their actions. Most people are stuck in this system and cannot get out because they are bound by selfish actions, they are too attached. Ishvara is an observer of this system. he does not get bound by Prakriti because he is unattached.        In order to free ourselves from the entrapment in Prakriti, we have to change our conditioning and rid ourselves of all misconceptions regarding Ishvara. The first misconception : Ishvara is finite human entity. The second misconception : I am body, mind, intellect.Third misconception: worship of finite deities will give infinite and permanent results. One by one, each of these misconceptions is clarified.        The easiest way to dispel all these misconceptions is to worship Ishvara, to follow the path of bhakti. There are several ways to bring this into our daily life. We can constantly meditate upon Ishvara as the cause of everything. This is known as \u201cjnyaana yagnya\u201d. We can perform actions in service of Ishvara. We can begin to see Ishvara in objects, people and situations through pointers. Shri Krishna provides several pointers. For instance, we can learn to see Ishvara in our parents, our grandparents, in the weather cycle and so on.        Next, Shri Krishna describes two kinds of devotees. The sakaama or desire-oriented devotee performs rituals so that he can attain heaven after his death, but ultimately comes back to earth after his merits are exhausted. The nishkaama or desire-less devotee only wants Ishvara. In an oft-quoted shloka, Shri Krishna says that Ishvara always takes care of desire-less devotees by giving them what they need at the right point in their lives including food, shelter, wealth, knowledge and a teacher.        We also learn that Ishvara does not expect big offerings when we worship him. In fact, he is happy with simple things like water, leaf, fruit or flowers. We can also offer our work and action to him when we serve others. What he wants the most is the feeling of devotion when we make the offering. Ishvara is impartial like the sun and rain, and will reward us based on our faith and effort.        The glory of devotion is that it is accessible to everybody, from sinners to people of great worldly attachment all the way to sages. Everyone can worship at any point in their lives. There is no qualification to begin the path of devotion.        Shri Krishna ends this chapter with an actionable message. He says \u201cKeep your mind in me, become my devotee, perform actions for me, surrender to me.\u201d This is the instruction for devotion towards Ishvara."

He gives us specific, tangible and practical instructions to bring the teachings of this chapter into our life. Having declared that this world is impermanent and devoid of joy, he wants us to follow a new way of life that orients us towards Ishvara and away from the world.        Let\u2019s look at the most important instruction first. Shri Krishna wants us to make Ishvara as our sole goal in life. How does this work in practice? If for instance, we are ready to go to college, it should be in line with our svadharma so that we get skilled in performing our work. If we want to get married, it should be with the intention of serving our family and our parents. Any time we serve someone else, we are serving Ishvara.        Now once this goal is set, everything else falls into place. Shri Krishna wants us to keep on contemplating Ishvara and perform all our actions for Ishvara. The more we do this, the more will our ego get subdued, and this is how we will convert ourselves into a true devotee. We may encounter people and situations that are unpleasant, disagreeable and not to our liking. Even in the midst of this we should bow down and surrender to Ishvara, knowing that it is our past actions that are manifesting as unpleasant but temporary situations.        What is the end result? If we are ever engaged with Ishvara throughout our lives, if we make Ishvara our goal and refuge, we will certainly attain him. This attainment is explained in the sixth chapter as \u201cYo maam pashyati sarvatra sarvam cha mayi pashyati\u201d. We will not view the world as different from us. We will see Ishvara in all, and all in Ishavara.        om tatsatiti shreematbhagavatgitasupanishadsu brahmavidyaayaam yogashaastre shreekrishnaarjunsamvade raajavidyaaraajaguhyayogo naama navamodhyaayaha || 9 ||"

Having described the glory of devotion, he then instructs Arjuna to worship Ishvara.        In describing the glory of devotion, Shri Krishna highlighted three types of people. The worst kind of person is a sinner, who has such a high level of attachment to the material world that he is ready to harm others. A better type of person is a sinner who has a lower level of attachment to the material world such as a businessperson. Better than that person is someone like a sage who has the lowest level of attachment, which means that highest level of detachment or vairagya. It does not matter which kind of person wants to become a devotee. Everyone is eligible.        Shri Krishna also explains the reason for seeking the path of devotion. He says that the world in which we live in has two main defects. It is anityam or impermanent, and it is asukham or devoid of joy. We usually rush into worldly pursuits such as money, positions, wealth, fame, titles and so on. None of those are permanent or will give long-lasting happiness. We sometimes think that others who possess these things are happier than we are, but that is not true. Impermanence and sorrow is the nature of this world.        Therefore, Shri Krishna urges us to follow a single pursuit. How do we do it? He explains this in the next and concluding shloka in this chapter."

Shri Krishna says that women, traders and labourers are born out of \u201cpaapa yoni\u201d which literally means \u201csinful wombs\u201d. He says that women, traders and labourers are also equally qualified to become liberated through the path of devotion. So to properly understand the meaning, let us look at the historical context and the symbolism that underpins this shloka.        As we have seen so far, the Gita attempts to remove misconceptions about spirituality that were prevalent when it came out. One prevalent misconception that was present throughout history was that only the brahmin and the kshatriya communities were solely qualified for liberation. Any other community was termed as \u201csinful\u201d. Therefore, Shri Krishna vehemently refutes this misconception using the language that was prevalent at that time.        Now let\u2019s look at the symbolism by focusing on the attributes of the communities mentioned, not by focusing on their birth-given caste or gender. A \u201csinful origin\u201d or \u201csinful womb\u201d per this shloka symbolically refers to a low level of sattva guna, and a high level of rajas and tamas which causes such attachment to worldly matters.        How does that manifest in people? The quality of being too attached to children and family is termed as \u201cwomen\u201d in this shloka. Similarly a \u201ctrader\u201d is too attached to money and commerce, and a \u201clabourer\u201d is too attached to the fruits of his own efforts. Unlike other types of spiritual practice that require a high level of detachment, bhakti or devotion does not require such a qualification. Therefore, Shri Krishna praises the path of devotion because anyone who has such deep attachments to worldly matters can attain liberation through devotion.        So, when even those with a material attachments can attain liberation through devotion, how do people with a high level of detachment fare? This is covered next."

Shri Krishna further adds to that statement by saying that one who makes such a resolve attains eternal bliss and peace. He also urges Arjuna to make such a resolve towards devotion.        Many commentators explain the word \u201ckshipram\u201d by snapping their fingers. In other words, the amount of time it takes to snap your fingers is how long it takes to make a commitment, to make a resolve towards devotion of Ishvara. When this happens, Ishvara ensures that such a person becomes virtuous and attains everlasting happiness and peace.        As long as we harbour desires for worldly objects, we will never experience long-lasting happiness. But by performing actions in the worship of Ishvara, our notion of doership and enjoyership is destroyed because we are acting as agents of Ishvara. When doership and enjoyership is removed, desires are automatically eliminated, resulting in everlasting peace and bliss.        Now, there could be a situation where we work in the spirit of worship for while, but fall back into our old desire-prompted actions again. Shri Krishna says that as long as we have made a commitment to devotion, Ishvara will ensure that we do not fall, we do not perish. However, Shri Krishna is specific in his statement that the resolve has to come from the devotee, not from Ishvara. Ishvara may break a promise that he has made himself, but he will always stand by a resolve that is made by his devotee.        So therefore, a person who has the tendency to commit wrongdoing can also become a devotee. What other types of people can become devotees? We shall see next."

He says that devotion is the easiest means of obtaining access to Ishvara. It is so easy that even a criminal, a sinner in the world can be considered a saint if he worships Ishvara with wholehearted devotion.        Why is bhakti so great as a means of accessing Ishvara? Bhakti has no prerequisites. It can be practiced by anyone at any stage in their life. There is financial, ancestral or intellectual requirement. Moreover, it is not alien to most of us. Many of us who grew up in the Indian tradition are already used to performing worship, even if it is for a minute in front of the deity in our living room. All we have to do is to expand this notion of worship to include everything we do.        Here, Shri Krishna says that if there is an individual that has extremely bad conduct, if he is the worst among sinners, if he starts worshipping Ishvara with single pointed devotion, this resolve is enough to uplift him to the status of a saint. The word \u201cananyabhaak\u201d is very important in this shloka. It means that this person has shifted his attention from all worldly pursuits including name, fame, money and power. His only goal is Ishvara.        So this person may not look like a saint outwardly, but he should be considered a saint, just like one who has checked into a flight is considered to have already reached the destination, even if it will take some more time. Such a saint has begun to shift his identification or sense of \u201cI-ness\u201d from his body to the infinite Ishvara. But his resolve or his commitment to this path is most important. He should be \u201csamyak vyavasitaha\u201d which means well determined, and be able to absolutely understand as to what is the right thing for him.        If this resolve is so important, how does one go about it? How long does it take? We shall see this next."

Shri Krishna addresses this doubt by saying that he is absolutely impartial and that he does not hate or favour anyone. The difference in the result obtained is entirely up to the effort and qualification of the seeker.        Consider a mother who has to feed two sons. One is a wrestler, and one is an invalid. She will give a lot of heavy food to the wrestler, and easy to digest food to the invalid. She cannot be accused of favouring the wrestler because she is giving food based on his efforts and his constitution. Or consider the sun who provides the same heat and light to everyone. If you build a solar power plant, you can generate electricity. If you don\u2019t, you will not be able to do so.        Similarly, Ishvara is same and equal to everyone. In the Mahabharata, Shri Krishna gave  Arjuna and Duryodhana. They could either use him or his powerful army for the war. Arjuna chose Shri Krishna and Duryodhana chose the army. It is the person who makes the right or wrong choice. We can either put a plug in the electrical socket or our finger. Electricity does not care, but the results will be different.        Now, if we truly devoted to our family for example, we do not see any barrier, difference, separation between our family and ourselves. Whatever do for them, it is as if we do it for us. Whatever they do for us, they do it as if they were doing it for themselves. Similarly, if we are truly devoted to Ishvara, we see him in us, and he sees us in him.        Here, the topic of sakaama and nishkaama is concluded (desire-oriented and desireless devotion). The topic of the glory of devotion is taken up next.        Footnotes1. Earlier Shri Krishna had said that Ishvara is not in anyone. This contradiction is resolved if we consider that each statement is made based on one\u2019s perspective. If we are a devotee, Ishvara is in us and we are in Ishvara. If we a materialistic, Ishvara is not in us."

Shri Krishna says that we shall be free of the results of action. Our actions give us results in the form of joy, sorrow, profit, loss, win, loss. Freedom from results leads to liberation and attainment of Ishvara. This is the ultimate result of living a worshipful life.        This shloka takes us back to the topic of renunciation. In an earlier portion of the Gita, Shri Krishna had redefined \u201csannyaasa\u201d or renunciation as giving up of the attitude of doership, not the giving up of action and retiring to a hermitage. By submitting our actions and their results in Ishvara hands, we automatically attain renunciation because we have come to know that it is Ishvara who is doing and enjoying everything.        As an illustration, let\u2019s consider our boss at work. If we do not have confidence in our boss\u2019s authority and his ability to lead us, our job becomes complicated, heavy and burdensome. Before we begin a task, we are worried whether we are doing the right things, and also fear the consequences of making a mistake. But if we trust our boss\u2019s authority and his ability to give us right direction, we work effortlessly and fearlessly knowing that we are carrying out the boss\u2019s command, and that he will take care of us if something goes wrong.        Similarly, once we realize that it is the infinite Ishvara that is directing everything, our actions automatically become effortless and fearless. It is like working for the most powerful CEO or the most powerful President, it gives us that kind of a confidence and peace of mind. We know that Ishvara is making us do the right things, and that he will take responsibility for the results and the consequences.        Now, if Ishvara is running everything, does that mean that he is partial to those who surrender to him and those who do not? This is taken up next."

Previously we learnt the technique of worshipping Ishvara using simple offerings like water. Once we get used to the worship of Ishvara in the home and in the temple, we need to bring that spirit of worship into all of our actions. In other words, we need to learn how to bring divinity into our actions. To that end, this shloka urges us to perform all actions as an act of worship towards Ishvara.        The simplest and most common action we perform is that of eating. Shri Krishna says that even the act of eating should be considered an act of worship. Traditionally, before every meal, the first five morsels are offered to the deity within with the words \u201cpraanaaya svaaha\u201d. The rest of the meal should be consumed with the attitude that the act of eating is occurring in the service of Ishvara, and not for the appeasement of our senses.        Now, take another action like exercising, for instance. How do we transform that into an act of worship? Anything that causes discomfort in the short term, but gets us gains in the long term, is an act of \u201ctapas\u201d or penance. Shri Krishna says that we can convert any action into a penance if we imbibe it with the attitude of worship. So if we have to take a long walk for exercising, for example, we can imagine that we are doing a \u201cpradakshina\u201d, that we walking around a temple. In this manner, even a discomforting act becomes divine.        Similarly, any action that requires strenuous effort and long hours can be made into an act of sacrifice. If we have to put in extra hours of work, we have to sacrifice our leisure time in the process. We can think of those extra hours of work as an offering in a \u201cyagnya\u201d or sacrifice.        In other words, we need go through elaborate rituals with fire and butter and priests and so on. Any action can be converted into an act of worship. When we donate, we can think that we are returning to Ishvara what was Ishvara\u2019s to begin with. When we go on a diet, we can imagine that we are conserving Ishvara\u2019s energy, and so on.        What is the rationale for \u201cdivinizing\u201d all of our actions? The notion of doership and enjoyership, the two main obstacles to liberation, get progressively diluted. Instead of thinking \u201cI did this\u201d and \u201cI enjoyed this\u201d, we begin to think that \u201cIshvara did it, and Ishvara gets the results\u201d. Consequently, our stress levels and worries begin to reduce as well.        This takes us back full circle to karma yoga, but with the added dimension of devotion. Karma yoga without bhakti yoga is incomplete. Without the attitude of devotion, we can potentially commit wrong or harmful actions that we will hesitate to perform in front of Ishvara. With devotion, karma yoga is complete.        Shri Krishna reveals the result of worshipful actions in the next shloka.        Footnotes:1. Devotion comprises three aspects: seva (service), shraddha (faith) and Ishvara mahaanata (greatness of Ishvara)"

He says that Ishvara does not want any expensive gifts. To become his devotee, we can give him something that nature offers in plenty for free: a leaf, a flower, a fruit or even some water.        Why is it important to give a gift to Ishvara? Building strong relationships requires actions and attitude. Take the example of a newly married husband and wife. How do they ensure that they maintain a strong bond? To start with, they can exchange gifts during events such as Valentine\u2019s day, their wedding anniversary with cards, flowers and so on.        But material exchanges in themselves are not sufficient. There has to be quality time spent with each other. Also, there has to be an exchange of meaningful thoughts, meaningful dialogue, not just talk about movies and sports etc.        The same thing also applies to worship. When we do all kinds of rituals for ourselves such as taking a bath, applying fragrance, eating food and so on, we can at least begin worshipping Ishvara by offering a flower or some water daily. Unless our mind and our actions are both engaged in Ishvara\u2019s worship, it will be difficult to build a strong bond with him.        Now, why is all this needed? One could say that we should just practice karma yoga by doing actions selflessly. But, karma yoga is incomplete without surrender to a higher ideal, and Ishvara is the highest possible ideal. Moreover, without the right emotional link to Ishvara, our pursuit will become dry and academic.        So therefore, when we offer a simple gift to Ishvara, but with an attitude of devotion, Ishvara happily consumes the gift. Our attitude should be similar to a small child presenting a gift to his father or mother, because in reality, we are offering to Ishvara what was his to begin with.        Once we have created this habit of worshipping Ishvara daily in our house, we should slowly bring it out of the house and into every action, as described in the next shloka."

In many cases, worship of individuals is something that we take for granted. If we need a loan, we have to worship the loan officer to gain his favour. If we need a job, we have to worship someone in that firm so that they can do a referral. If we need admission into a school, we have to worship the admissions officer.        The eighteenth chapter of the Gita categorizes every action into three types: saatvic, raajasic and taamasic. Worship of a guru for knowledge is saatvic worship. Worship of a loan officer for a loan is raajasic worship. Worship of a gangster to kill someone is taamasic worship. But ultimately, any knowledge that comes under the realm of the three gunaas is finite.        In this shloka, Shri Krishna gives examples of worship towards deities, ancestors and spirits that encompass most kinds of so-called spiritual worship performed today. However, as we saw earlier, the best that this kind worship can give us is a finite material result. Even if we get to go to heaven through such worship, we will have to come back to earth one day when our merits are exhausted.        The infinite Ishvara has ability to give us liberation. Instead of asking that, we ask finite things like exam success, job success and so on. It is like asking a millionaire for pennies. We do so because we have conditioned ourselves to accept very narrow materialistic definitions of success. If our definition of success is narrow, our definition of Ishvara somehow becomes narrow as well.        So therefore, we come to the conclusion that we have to learn the correct technique of worshipping Ishvara. How does that work? Is it something arcane and complex? Shri Krishna provides a beautiful answer to that question next."

This type of worship in itself is ok, but the result obtained through this worship can only be finite. Shri Krishna says that the reason most devotees commit this error because they do not recognize Ishvara in essence, they do not comprehend the real nature of Ishvara.        Imagine that people from a remote village visit a city. They may mistake a minister\u2019s office for the nation\u2019s government. They may mistake a computer for the Internet. They may mistake a power outlet for the electric grid. Just like such people will commit grave errors unless they understand the presence of the larger in the small, we also will commit errors in our worship unless we understand the real infinite nature of Ishvara.        So therefore, when we act in this world, we should always bear in mind that the recipient of any action is Ishvara. When we feed someone, care for someone, help someone in need, we should know that ultimately we are feeding, caring for and helping Ishvara. This will reduce our sense of ego or I-ness.         Furthermore, emotions such as pride, greed and jealousy are caused because we think we own something, or we covet something that others own. If we know that the ultimate owner of everything is Ishvara, it reduces our sense of attachment and \u201cmine-ness\u201d. Ego and attachment are great obstacles in the path of liberation, and this knowledge cuts them down.        What is the fate of such faulty worship? This is taken up next."

Shri Krishna again invokes that theme in this shloka. He says that those devotees who worship deities other than the infinite Ishvara ultimately worship him, but do so in a wrong manner.        Many of us have been brought up in a tradition in which we worship a specific deity. As children, we are taught to invoke that deity during auspicious occasions, during periods of prosperity as well as periods of difficulty. We should be grateful to our parents for inculcalting these good sanskaaraas or habits in us at an early age. However, Shri Krishna says that as we grow older, it is important to have the correct knowledge of what we are worshipping, because in most cases, our knowledge is limited and incorrect.        What is this incorrect knowledge? Thinking that what we are worshipping is a finite deity in a certain form is incorrect knowledge. When we see a small government office, we do not make the mistake of thinking that a small office contains the government of an entire nation. Or when we look at a wave, we never imagine that the entire ocean is just that small wave.        Similarly, even though we worship a finite deity in our home or in a temple, we should never think that we are worshipping just that finite deity. If we think in that way, our worship will be incorrect, it will have a flaw.        So then, what is the right knowledge? It is knowing that we are worshipping Ishvara in his infinite nature. Just like we contact the entire Internet when we surf the web on our phone, we contact the infinite Ishvara when we worship a finite deity. Ishvara is the foundation of everything, therefore ultimately all prayers reach Ishvara.        Why do most devotees commit this error? This is explained next."

This oft-quoted shloka contains Ishvara\u2019s promise to all devotees. Here, Shri Krishna assures us that Ishvara will personally attend to the needs of his devotees. But he also defines the type of devotee that is being discussed here. It is one who is ever absorbed in the contemplation of Ishvara. For such people, there is no fear, suffering, sorrow or lack of anything.        Previously, we learned about the \u201csakaama bhakta\u201d or desire oriented devotee. This shloka describes the \u201cnishkaama bhakta\u201d or desireless devotee. Who is a nishkaama bhakta? It is the one who is only seeking one thing: moksha, liberation. His desire for moksha is equal to no other desire, for that desire will permanently eliminate all other desires. it is a desire for infinitude or poornatva. He has \u201cananya\u201d or focused goal, other devotees have \u201canya\u201d or diverse goals.        So if we are desireless devotees, if our only desire is liberation which is the attainment of Ishvara, what does Ishvara do for us? Shri Krishna says that Ishvara takes care of \u201cyoga\u201d and \u201ckshema\u201d. Our entire life comprises two major activities: acquisition and preservation. The early part of our life goes in acquisition of knowledge, wealth, family, position and title. This is denoted by the word \u201cyoga\u201d. The later part of our life is devoted to preservation of what we have acquired. This is \u201ckshema\u201d.        Many commentators cite a wonderful story to illustrate this shloka. There was a brahmin who had great faith in this shloka, but lost it one day because his family did not get enough alms to have a proper meal one day. In disgust, he tore the palm leaf on which this shloka was written and went out of the house. Later, a boy came to his house with a sack of rations. He informed the brahmin\u2019s wife that her husband had sent her the food.        The brahmin\u2019s wife noticed that the boy\u2019s tongue was bleeding. She found out from the boy that it was her husband who had cut off the boy\u2019s tongue. When the brahmin came back, the wife rebuked him for injuring the boy who had delivered the rations. The brahmin, it turns out, knew nothing about the boy or the rations. He quickly realized that it was Ishvara who delivered the food, and that when he tore the palm leaf, it injured Ishvara in the form of that boy. So Ishvara did not just deliver the food, he also carried the rations on his back. This is what is meant by the word \u201cvahaami\u201d which means \u201cto carry\u201d.        What is the practical implication of this shloka? If we wholly devote ourselves to the pursuit of Ishvara, we need not spend any time incessantly worrying about our needs. As long as we perform our duties efficiently and in a spirit of service to Ishvara, we will be well taken care of. Ishvara will not just carry our burden of needs, he will also carry all of our worries as well.        The culmination of this shloka\u2019s vision is the knowledge that there is no such thing as \u201cmy\u201d need or \u201cyour\u201d need. If everything is Ishvara and everything is in Ishvara, then he will take care of his own needs, just like our fingers are not worrying about someone taking care of their individual needs.        What happens to those who do not worship Ishvara in his infinite nature? This is explained in the upcoming shlokas."

Shri Krishna says that their efforts will bear fruit on earth as well as in heaven. However, he says that their stay in heaven is temporary. After their stay ends, they once again come back to earth and get caught up in the endless cycle of birth and death.        As an example, consider the plight of those people who work hard, earn a good living but have trouble managing their spending. As soon as they get their salary, they instantly spend most of it on the first of the month, and barely manage to pay their bills for the remainder of the month. They somehow forget that fact that money, like anything else in this world, is finite.        Similarly, people who enjoy heavenly pleasures stay in heaven until their merits (punya) are depleted. Once that happens, they come back to earth and are born into a human form if they are lucky, or some other form if they are not.        Shri Krishna says that such people follow the \u201cthree-fold system\u201d. This refers to Vedic knowledge comprising the three modes or gunaas. Since the gunaas themselves are finite and transient, the results attained by the followers of these gunaas will also be finite and transient.        So therefore, although the desire-oriented devotee is better than someone who has no room for devotion, he is still trapped in a pursuit of comfort in pleasure in this world as well as in other worlds. Unlike such a devotee, what we should truly desire is liberation or moksha.        What kind of devotee gets liberation? This is taken up next."

There are predominantly two types of devotees: desire-oriented (sakaama) and desireless (nishkaam). Desire-oriented devotees are described in these two shlokas. Note the change to a longer meter to emphasize a change in the topic.        Who is the desire-oriented bhakta? He is a devotee who worships Ishvara for a material gain. He either wants merits (punya), wealth (artha), earthly joy (sukha), heavenly joy (svaraga) or a combination of these four. In simple words he is looking for money, name and fame.         So for example, if someone wants to buy a car, they pray that it is the right price and that it is in stock. If someone has an exam, they pray that they pass in the exam. Vedas and rituals mentioned in this shloka refer to the efforts that we put into appeasing Ishvara. We may not perform elaborate rituals, but there always is a thought that \u201cplease God let this happen so that I can be happy\u201d, which amounts to the same thing as the rituals mentioned here.        Now, when a child asks his parents for something insignificant, a parent feels frustrated because the parent has the capability to give much greater value, but cannot do so because the child insists on that insignificant thing. Similarly, Ishvara also may feel sometimes that the things we ask of him \u2013 wealth, heavenly pleasures and so on \u2013 are insignificant. Such people do not have a strong resolve towards liberation, they do not have the \u201cvyavasaatmikaa buddhi\u201d mentioned in chapter 2. Their focus is diverted away from Ishvara towards material pursuits.        Assuming they somehow accumulate merits and attain heaven, what happens next?"

In that regard, since we deal with the weather everyday, it can become a great pointer to access Ishvara. However, anytime the climate becomes too hot, or there is excessive rain or drought, our body feels uncomfortable, and therefore we do not even think of Ishvara when those things happen.        Shri Krishna says in the shloka that it is Ishvara that is providing the heat as the sun. So when it gets extremely hot, we should recognize that it is Ishvara that is providing the energy for the sun. And even though we may feel uncomfortable, we should realize that Ishvara has the welfare of the entire earth in mind. When it gets hot, the water on earth rises to form clouds, and is eventually sent back as rain. If the sun were never to give enough heat, we would never get any rain on earth.        Shri Krishna also says that Ishvara is found in immortality as well as in death. Symbolically, what is meant here is that knowing Ishvara as an infinite entity is real immortality, and knowing Ishvara as finite is death. When we see only waves and foam in the ocean, we will eventually see them \u201cdie\u201d. But when we only see the ocean, there is no death whatsoever.        How do we develop such a vision? By knowing what is \u201csat\u201d or real and what is \u201casat\u201d or not real. Just because something is perceived by our senses, it does not automatically become real. Optical illusions are a great example. This echoes the lessons of the second chapter where Shri Krishna encourages us to develop \u201ctattva drishti\u201d or the vision of the essence, not of names and forms.

The karmaphaa, the fruit of our action, leads us to our destination or goal. The actions are the means, and the fruit of the actions is the goal. Shri Krishna says that Ishvara is the highest goal that we can aspire to. \u201cBhartaa\u201d is the controller and supporter of the entire universe. It literally means someone who provides for his family. Ishvara nourishes and takes care of all beings in this universe, hence he is the provider of the universe. Since he is also the ultimate controller and master, he is known as \u201cPrabhuhu\u201d.        When we are kids, we aspire to become like our parents. They provide for us and also control our activities. They are our gatihi, bhartaa and prabhuhu. But if they get too attached to us, they will continue planning our life even when we become adults. That is why Ishvara remains an unattached witness, or \u201csaakshi\u201d.        Furthermore, Ishvara is the \u201cnivaasaha\u201d or container of the universe. He is \u201csharanam\u201d, the ultimate refuge when there is no one else left for us to turn to. He is a well wisher or \u201csuhrita\u201d, someone who does not expect anything in return. Ishvara creates, dissolves and maintains the universe therefore he is \u201cprabhavaha\u201d, \u201cpralaya\u201d and \u201csthaanam\u201d. He is also \u201cnidhaanam\u201d, the repository where all beings become unmanifest at the end of creation.        Finally, Ishvara is the seed that has created the universe. Unlike most seeds that can only generate one plant, Ishvara continues to create the universe infinitely, without modification. Hence he is called the imperishable seed \u201cavyayam beejam\u201d."

A father\u2019s nature is to protect the child and to push it to grow. A mother embodies the quality of nurture and impartiality, she will care for even the most misbehaved child. A grandfather is extremely attached to his grandchild and takes great pleasure in demonstrating affection towards the child, whereas the father may sometimes not show affection openly. Shri Krishna says that Ishvara treats every being in the universe like a caring family would.        Symbolically, Ishvara as father represents the intelligence behind the creation of the universe. Ishvara as mother represents the substance that creates the universe. Ishvara as grandfather refers to the source of intelligence and substance. It is said that Lord Shiva, when asked for his great grandfather\u2019s name, replied \u201cShiva\u201d. There is no further cause of this universe other than Ishvara.        Another pointer to Ishvara is \u201cdhaata\u201d or sustainer. As we have seen earlier, it is Ishvara in his infinite nature that holds the universe together in a state of harmony, where everything is in its place. Ishvara is also the three Vedas which are ultimate source of knowledge in the universe, the only knowledge that needs to be known. Their essence is captured in the syllable \u201cOm\u201d, which is considered the utmost purifier. In other words, once we see Ishvara in everything, everything becomes pure.        The next shloka contains a series of pointers to Ishvara which are considered the foundation of bhakti or devotion."

It is not enough to consider Ishvara as a finite resident in a picture or an idol. We should be able to incorporate Ishvara in all aspects of our lives. In this shloka, Shri Krishna emphasizes work as a connection to Ishvara by saying that Ishvara is present within all aspects of action.        During the time of the Mahabharata war, Vedic rituals were a part and parcel of life and were well understood by all. To that end, Shri Krishna asks Arjuna to view Ishvara in each and every aspect of the vedic ritual. Since such rituals comprise herbs, butter, chanting, fire, and offering of oblations, Shri Krishna says that Ishvara is present in all of them. Arjuna would have had no trouble in ensuring that Ishvara was ever present in such a ritual after he heard this shloka.        We, however, lack exposure to such rituals, and therefore we adapt this shloka towards any action that we perform daily. For example, if we are cooking a meal for our family, we can see Ishvara in the cooking flame, in the spices, in the vegetables, in the oil, in the knife and so on. Or if we spend a lot of time creating documents on the computer, then we can try to see Ishvara in the laptop, the mouse, the word document, the browser and so on.        Shri Krishna, by redefining action as worship of Ishvara, does not demarcate when and who can worship Ishvara. Sant Kabirdas was a cobbler and Arjuna was a warrior. But both of them could access Ishvara without leaving their respective professions. We have the opportunity to do the very same thing. It is our attitude while performing our work which is most important.        Further means to access Ishvara are provided next."

He says that recalling and remembering the infinite nature of Ishvara throughout our lives is a form of worship called jnyaana yaganya or the sacrifice of knowledge. Unlike most forms of worship, we can perform it without any effort anytime, anywhere. All we have to do is to learn to see Ishvara in everything.        There are several spiritual traditions that have somewhat differing notions of Ishvara\u2019s nature. The tradition of Adi Shankaracharya, which this book tries to follow closely, views the jeeva and Ishvara as one. Acharya Ramanuja\u2019s tradition views jeeva as a part of Ishvara. Acharya Madhva\u2019s tradition views the jeeva and Ishvara as separate entities. Shri Krishna enumerates all of these viewpoints in this shloka, then reconciles all three by saying that all are equally valid as sacrifices of knowledge.        Regardless of the tradition followed, Shri Krishna urges us to continuously perform the sacrifice of knowledge so that we weaken our individuality while strengthening our faith in Ishvara. When we see more Ishvara in everything and everyone, our likes and dislikes start thinning down as well. We also begin to realize that all our joys and sorrows are tied to our actions, and so we begin to treat everything as a \u201cprasaada\u201d or Ishvara\u2019s gift.        Shri Krishna now begins to give us pointers on where and how to see Ishvara."

We should try to bring as many qualities as we can into our lives, and not think that they are only for some select extraordinary people.        Firstly, Shri Krishna says that these noble individuals perform \u201ckeertan\u201d and \u201cbhajan\u201d. Typically, we tend to think of keertan as singing songs in front of a deity. But here, the meaning is deeper. Keertan here means the three step process of hearing scriptures (shravanam), resolving doubts (mananam) and internalizing the knowledge (nidhidhyaasanam). It is only through this process that the true nature of Ishvara is understoood.        It is also imperative to perform keertan as frequently as possible. As we have seen so far, Prakriti needs no help in order to ensnare us daily with the temptation of name and form. Also, Prakriti is not just responsible for visible objects but also thoughts, feelings, emotions and memories that can lead to straying away from Ishvara. Repeated keertan is the only way to guard against such distractions.        Shri Krishna also emphasizes the power of \u201cvrata\u201d or resolution. Most spiritual traditions encourage practices like fasting or abstaining from pleasures during certain days. Observance of such vows strengthens our will power so that we can use that inner strength towards fending off Prakriti. Knowledge of Ishvara, without the will power to remain established in that knowledge, will not work. If someone cannot even remain without food for a day, it will be difficult for them to deal with the might of Prakriti.        Another aspect of the noble individuals is that they do \u201cnamaskaara\u201d to Ishvara, which means that they offer themselves to Ishvara. When things are going well, it is easy to accept the will of Ishvara. However, many individuals begin to lose faith in Ishvara when they go through a rough period in their lives. True veneration happens when we realize that even the rough period in our life happens for a reason that we will understand in the course of time.        Broadly speaking, Shri Krishna wants the devotee to dedicate not just his intellect but also his mind. Unless we engage with anything at an emotional level, our pursuit will always be dry, academic and partial. It will be like a PhD student who forgets what he learned right after he receives his degree.        So therefore, Shri Krishna says that individuals with these qualities are the true devotees. They have understood the true method of \u201cupanasanaa\u201d, of worshipping Ishvara. That is why they remain \u201cnitya yukta\u201d or always united and connected with Ishvara, and also, Ishvara remains ever united with them.        Next, Shri Krishna enumerates the different ways in which these noble individuals worship Ishvara."

These \u201cmahaatmaas\u201d or noble individuals treat Ishvara as their one and only one refuge, and worship him with unwavering devotion. With a view to instruct us in the ways of such noble individuals, Shri Krishna devotes the next few shlokas to this topic.        The word \u201caashritaha\u201d or refuge is key to understanding this shloka. What does this word mean? It is how we answer the question \u201cwhen I am in trouble, what do I turn to?\u201d. Most of us have various sources of refuge. For some, it is their ancestral inheritance. For some, it is their academic qualifications. For some, it is their family. Whenever we are in trouble, we pursue those avenues for comfort and security.        However, the mahaatmaas or noble individuals do not look to any of these sources for refuge. They have understood one simple fact: anything that can change over time is under the control of Prakriti. Prakriti, the realm of name and form, is every changing and can never be relied upon for support all the time. We ourselves would have encountered several instances where money or family did not help someone in their time of need. The noble individuals know that there is only one true refuge that is universal and unchanging: it is Ishvara.        Knowing this, what do the noble individuals do? They are \u201cananya manasaha\u201d, they are singularly devoted to Ishvara. Even though they may be tempted by Prakriti\u2019s play and dazzle of name and form, they know that ultimately every source of joy that it gives, turns into sorrow eventually. Furthermore, their devotion for Ishvara is not for the attainment for anything else. It is solely for the attainment of Ishvara.        Unlike these noble individuals, most of us still rush into Prakriti for joy, comfort, security and support. But Prakriti teaches us a lesson over our lifetime when we repeatedly seek joy which turns into sorrow. How do the noble individuals remain focused in Ishvara while living in the world of Prakriti? We shall see next."

He has done so because erroneous knowledge is the start of a chain of consequences that can either uplift or ruin our life, not just from a spiritual but also material perspective. He illustrates that chain in this shloka.        Consider a child born into a family that gives utmost important to the acquisition of money, but does not emphasize the ethical means of doing so. Such an erroneous knowledge starts a chain of consequences. The child always desires money, and all his actions are directed towards the pursuit of money.        Shri Krishna calls these useless desires and useless actions. All of these eventually lead to increasingly worse character traits in the child. He can undertake delusory actions (gambling), evil actions (stealing) or worse yet, devilish actions (murder), all because of the wrong notion that acquisition of money is paramount.        Broadly, if we start with the erroneous notion that our body and mind is everything and that Ishvara is a distant finite entity, all our desires and actions will be directed towards ensuring that our body can live comfortably. We will continue to make external adjustments such as moving to a new city or changing jobs in search of comfort and security, to continually appease our body and mind, and to gain freedom from sorrow. Since we have not acquired the knowledge of our true nature and Ishvara\u2019s true natures, we will never understand that Ishvara is our ultimate source of security and the ultimate freedom from sorrow.        So we have seen that erroneous knowledge about Ishvara can lead to ultimate ruin. Who then, are those people that, having had the correct knowledge, develop the right type of relationhip with Ishvara? This is taken up next."

Even though Shri Krishna has repeatedly defined Ishvara as infinite, many people still get stuck with one form of Ishvara or the other. In this shloka, Shri Krishna terms such people foolish, and their behaviour insulting.        Now, many of us were conditioned by our cultures to believe that Ishvara is something that is far away, and will take years and years of devotion to achieve. But Shri Krishna, through the Gita, has revealed to us the true nature of Ishvara as infinite, all-pervading and available right here and now. To ensure that we do not revert back to our old ways of thinking, Shri Krishna uses a strong term to refer to such people: foolish.        Even before we go to the level of Ishvara, we commit the error of thinking that our eternal essence, our self, is our human body only. Removing this erroneous notion was the message of the second chapter. In the same way, we are likely to think of Ishvara as a finite form, and in doing so, treat everything else in the world with disregard.        Shri Krishna says that such an attitude is personally insulting to Ishvara, who is the supreme controller of the universe. It is like introducing a Nobel peace prize winner as an ordinary citizen, or to think that a junior police officer is the be-all and end-all of a country\u2019s government. People with such erroneous notions can cause a great deal of harm to themselves, as is pointed out in the next shloka."

He describes Ishvara as the supervisor, the \u201cadhyaksha\u201d. He says that Ishvara does not physically have to \u201cdo\u201d anything in order to create, sustain and dissolve the universe. Ishvara\u2019s mere presence enables Prakriti to function, just like electricity enables a television to function. Without his presence, Prakriti remains inert and is incapable of doing anything whatsoever.        From Ishvara\u2019s standpoint, there is no notion of \u201cdoing work\u201d or \u201cobtaining the result\u201d; he knows that ultimately it is Prakriti that runs the show, and therefore he remains detached. He is like the owner of a theatre that has employed a magician to perform a show. The owner is unconcerned whether the magician cuts a woman in half with a saw, or pulls a rabbit out of a hat.        Let us now look at the practical implication this shloka. If we substitute the word Ishvara in the previous statement with the word \u201cjeeva\u201d or individual, we come to the same conclusion from the previous chapters on karma yoga. Only through disassociation with the notion that \u201cI am the doer\u201d and \u201cI obtain the result\u201d can we truly be liberated from the cycle of creation and dissolution.        The key question is : who controls whom? If we let Prakriti control us, if we let our lower nature drag us towards sense pleasure, we  can never be liberated. We should re-assert our control of our lower self through our higher self.        Furthermore, Shri Krishna also gives us a technique to deal with life\u2019s ups and downs with this shloka. Whenever we encounter a sorrowful or hurtful situation, all we need to do is to know that (a) we have obtained this situation through our own actions and (b) it is yet another name and form that Prakriti has created.        Once we know that something is a name and form, we will immediately know that it is Prakriti\u2019s handiwork, just like we know that something is an April fool\u2019s joke or a magician\u2019s trick. This will enable us to pierce through Prakriti\u2019s pranks and to know that Ishvara the supervisor is behind everything.        So then, Shri Krishna has explained to us \u201chow the universe revolves\u201d, in other words, how the magic trick works. This is how we should develop our vision of the world. However, instead of trying to see Ishvara behind everything, many people still try to box Ishvara into a finite concept. More on this is taken up in the next shloka."

He asserted that Ishvara cannot be contained in any one part of the universe, in any one object. He also asserted that we need to wait for a long time to Ishvara. Ishvara is accessible at this very moment. What is missing is knowledge that enables us to recognize Ishvara in everything.        In this shloka, Shri Krishna addresses another misconception of Ishvara, that he has a personal agenda in each and everyone\u2019s destiny. To that end, Shri Krishna clarifies that Ishvara delegates the functioning of the universe to the laws of Prakriti. He does not personally get involved, nor does he claim credit for the creation, destruction and sustenance of billions of beings in this universe.        Our Puranaas contains several stories about the trinity of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva who are charged with the responsibilities of creation, sustenance and dissolution respectively. They are aided by their consorts. Saraswati provides the knowledge needed for creation. Lakshmi provides the wealth needed for sustenance. Parvati provides the power needed for dissolution. The stories may portray that these deities personally take effort to perform their duties, but at the universal level, they are all part of the fully automatic system of Prakriti.        Therefore, the lessons for us here is that we should follow karma yoga because it is a universal law. Like Ishvara, who runs the universe while knowing that it is Prakriti\u2019s handiwork, we too should perform our duties in a spirit of vairagya or detachment, knowing that Prakriti is running everything. If we worry about who will get the credit for our actions, then we will get bound, taking us further away for liberation.        So then, how should we use this knowledge to refine our vision towards the world? This is explained next."

Prakriti is Ishvara\u2019s projector. It projects an entire universe of names and forms at the beginning of a cycle, withdraws them at the end of the cycle, only to start it all over again. We saw this in the previous shlokas. Here, we investigate the relationship between Prakriti, Ishvara and the individual.        Let\u2019s first look at the relationship between Ishvara and Prakriti. Shri Krishna says that Ishvara fully controls Prakriti. He is the commander of Prakriti. Prakriti cannot do anything without the command of Ishvara. However, Ishvara is not a micro-manager. He does not tell Prakriti how to do its job. He just sets the rules in motion. Prakriti is a system that follows the rules, just like a computer program or the autopilot in an aircraft.        How does this work? We know that Prakriti, which is a synonym for maaya, comprises the three gunaas or modes. Each guna will deliver results based on its inherent property. For example, if our personality is predominantly comprised of rajas, we will always be in an agitated state, which will result in haphazard work. But if our personality is saatvic, it will result in perfect work. Notice that there is no need for Ishvara to \u201cdo\u201d anything since Prakriti is an automatic system.        Next, let us look at the nature of Prakriti and the individual. Shri Krishna says that the individual is under the complete control of Prakriti. He helplessly goes through infinite cycles of birth and death due to the influence of Prakriti. In our own lives, we know so many people that are hale and hearty one moment, and are killed by an accident in the next moment. They have no say in the matter whatsoever. The only way one can get out of Prakriti\u2019s influence is to put forth effort towards achieving liberation.        Now, we know that Ishvara commands Prakriti to perform creation, sustenance and dissolution. In the chapter on karma yoga, we have seen that actions have a tendency to bind us, to make us get attached to them. Does Ishvara get attached to the actions of creation, sustenance and dissolution? We shall see in the next shloka."

Here, he asserts that all those beings go to Ishvara\u2019s Prakriti at the end of a \u201ckalpa\u201d or age. They then  come back into existence when the kalpa starts all over again.        In the last chapter, Shri Krishna had explained the process of creation and dissolution. He spoke about the day and night of Lord Brahma. Here, he adds more detail by revealing the orchestrator of creation and dissolution. It is Prakriti. In an earlier context, this word was translated as nature. In this context, we will keep the original word since the meaning is a little different.        Prakriti is a system that tracks the karmas or actions of each and every being in the universe. When every being\u2019s karma is exhausted, Shri Krishna, through the medium of Prakriti, begins the process of dissolution, just like we go to sleep when we exhaust all our actions for the day. When the time is right for the next set of actions to begin manifesting, Prakriti \u201cwakes\u201d up everyone and begins the process of creation.        Now, we notice that Shri Krishna does not use the word \u201ccreate\u201d here. Instead, he uses the word \u201cproject\u201d. Prakriti is similar to a movie projector in that it does not create anything new, but projects names and forms on the screen, just like waves and foam in the ocean. As we saw earlier, creation and dissolution is a matter of perspective. A child only sees waves and foam. The adult, seeing the very same waves and foam, knows that it is ultimately water.        Similarly, creation and dissolution on a cosmic scale is \u201creal\u201d only if we get stuck at the level of names and forms. The jnyaani or the wise seeker sees the names and forms come and go, but knows that everything, ultimately, is only Ishvara. The difference between the jnyaani and everyone else is that the wise seeker\u2019s perspective that comes from having the knowledge of Ishvara. This knowledge is paramount.        So then, what is the relationship between Ishvara, Prakriti and us? This is explained in the next shloka."

To illustrate these statements, Shri Krishna compares Ishvara to space. He says that space enables everything to exist within it, like wind, for example. In the same way, all living and non-living entities dwell in Ishvara.        First, let us understand the nature of space. It is indivisible, which means that even if we try to divide it by building walls, we cannot do so. It does not get affected by what it contains. A flower generates fragrance when fresh and odour when it decays. But both those qualities do not get transferred to space, since space has no qualities. It also pervades everything. Over 99% of an atom is empty space. And it is infinite. No object can ever contain space.        Similarly, Shri Krishna says that Ishvara is infinite, indivisible, pervades everything, and remains unaffected by what he sustains. How does this help us? Knowing that Ishvara is everywhere reduces our sorrow, delusion, fear, likes and dislikes. If everything is Ishvara, and if we also know that we are in Ishvara, there is nothing to fear or like or dislike. That is how we get liberated.        There is a story in the Ishvaavaasya Upanishad. The gods tried to have a race with Ishvara. But wherever they ended up, Ishvara was already there. Another interpretation of this story is that the senses also tried to outrun Ishvara, but could not. It is like trying to race with space. It is a futile effort, because space is all-pervading. So is Ishvara.        Now, just like we see the blue sky with our eyes, we also see things and people on this earth being created and destroyed. We know that the blue colour is an illusion, but do we really understand that creation and dissolution is an illusion as well? This is taken up next."

He says that what we see through our eyes, hear through our nose, touch through our skin is just a series of names and forms. It is a divine power of Ishvara, just like the skill of a magician. These names and forms appear as if they are created, sustained and destroyed by Ishvara, but in reality, there is no such thing.        We notice that the first statement \u201call beings do not reside in me\u201d contradicts the statement in the last shloka \u201call beings are based in me.\u201d This is because each statement is made from a different perspective, based on our level of understanding.        If we think that the world of names and forms is real, then Ishvara says that all beings are based in him. It is like the little girl thinking that the foam and the waves in the ocean are real entities.        But, if we advance our understanding, if we know that the world of names and forms is a play of Ishvara, then he says that none of those beings, those names and forms, reside in him. The illusion of the magician does not reside in the magician, because an illusion cannot reside in something real. That is why Shri Krishna says that Ishvara\u2019s self is not contained in all beings.        Now, even though we have this knowledge, will still see, hear, touch, feel and taste the world. Those forms in the world will be created, survive, and eventually dissolve. Our near and dear ones will prosper, but will also leave us one day. All of this is a play of Ishvara\u2019s maayaa. To this end, he asserts that he is the creator and sustainer of these names and forms.        As an example, we look up at the sky and observe that it is blue in colour. We know that the blue colour is just an illusion caused by the scattering of light waves. However, even after we know this, our eyes still report the color of the sky as blue. Similarly, Shri Krishna urges us to recognize that Ishvara\u2019s divine power of maayaa, his \u201chome theatre system\u201d, creates all the names and forms that our lives are made up of.        So then, what is the essence of these two key shlokas? Our senses will always report names and forms to our mind and intellect. If we know that they are all illusory names and forms, we will gain liberation. If we get sucked into thinking that they are real, we will be trapped in their apparent reality.        This teaching requires further elaboration. To that end, Shri Krishna provides an illustration in the next shloka."

        "content": "mayaa tatamidam sarvam jagadavyaktamoortinaa |matsthaani sarva bhootaani na chaaham teshvavasthitaha || 4 ||        This entire universe is pervaded by my unmanifest state. All beings are based in me, I am not based in them.        mayaa : mytatam : pervadedidam : thissarvam : entirejagat : universeavyakta : unmanifestmoortinaa : statematsthaani : based in mesarva : allbhootaani : beingsna : notcha : andaham : Iteshu : in themavasthitaha : based        This shloka and the next are the crux of the teaching in this chapter. Shri Krishna makes three core points: that the entire universe is pervaded by his unmanifest state, that all beings are based in him, and that he is not based in them. Let us first take a step back to understand the context of this teaching before we delve into these three points.        The eighth chapter described meditative techniques that we had to follow throughout our lives in order to attain Ishvara, so that we can be liberated from the cycle of creation and dissolution. Now, Shri Krishna reveals a secret that will enable us to immediately gain access to Ishvara 24/7. And unlike other techniques described so far, we do not have to do any action. We just have to know.        What is this secret knowledge? Let us start with the first point. Shri Krishna says that Ishvara is present in every living and non-living being within this universe. If that\u2019s the case, then we do not need to put in any extra effort. Once we train ourselves to view Ishvara in everything, we will gain access to him 24/7. We will not need to do any extra physical or mental activity to make that happen. But if it were that simple, why cannot we put it into practice immediately? It is because we have been preconditioned since time immemorial to see everything but Ishvara. Removing this preconditioning is the topic of the Gita.        The second point made by Shri Krishna is that all beings are based in him. Let us bring up the example of the ocean and the waves to understand this point. A five year old girl sitting on the beach will look at the waves, the foam and the ripples and conclude that they are independent things. But her mother knows that all of those shapes are created because of the ocean. Also, the girl who has to inquire about where these shapes come from. The mother does not have to do anything. She just knows that everything is nothing but water in the ocean. So the mother will tell her, \u201cthat\u2019s just the ocean\u201d.        Now, let\u2019s say the girl sees a ripple in a lake instead of the ocean. She points to it and says \u201cthat\u2019s the ocean\u201d. The mother will now enhance her statement slightly by saying \u201cthat is not the ocean, that is a ripple. It is just a shape taken by water, which is in the ocean and in the lake\u201d. Water is an abstract concept which a child slowly learns by example.        Similarly, we may begin to think that Ishvara is resident in an idol, or a saint, or a holy place. Like the ripple, they are names and forms. Even Arjuna would have found it hard to believe that Shri Krishna, who is in front of him, can pervade the entire universe. So therefore, Shri Krishna says that no visible entity can ever contain Ishvara who is beyond name and form. The true nature of Ishvara is formless. This is the third point in this shloka.        Still, a question remains. Just like we still see waves in the ocean even after knowing that they are water, we still come across thousands of names and forms everyday. Many of those names and forms are people that we interact with, speak with, work with and so on. Aren\u2019t those people \u201creal\u201d? How do we reconcile this? Shri Krishna addresses this confusion in the next shloka."

Addressing Arjuna as the \u201cscorcher of foes\u201d, he says that they key qualification required to receive this teaching is that of faith. If we do not have faith, we continue following our old ways, only to be trapped in this endless cycle of creation and dissolution.        Why is there so much importance placed in faith? Without faith, we will not have the inclination to fully understand any teaching. Even in school or college, we will not take the extra effort to inquire, ask questions, read books and resolve our doubts unless we have faith in the subject and the teacher. It is even more important in this kind of knowledge.        So then, what happens to those that do not have faith? Shri Krishna says that such people do not attain Ishvara. They have faith in their sense organs and their corresponding sense pleasures. These people still think that feeding their senses with more food, entertainment as well as bodily and intellectual comforts will result in long-lasting happiness. This misplaced faith further ensnares them in the path of the mortal world, which that of birth, old age, disease and death, over and over again.        Having sufficiently introduced the chapter, Shri Krishna delivers the main message of this chapter in the following two shlokas."

This shloka comprises a series of adjectives that highlight the extremely unique and special nature of the knowledge that he is about to reveal.        He begins by describing this knowledge as royal. It means that this knowledge is the king among any knowledge, it is foremost among all the other knowledge. As we saw in an earlier chapter, most knowledge we acquire in our life is \u201caparaa vidyaa\u201d. It is related to something material and temporary. This chapter describes \u201cparaa vidyaa\u201d, knowledge of the absolute. Knowing this, we will ourselves become kings. We will never become subservient to anyone or anything, including our mind, body and senses.        This knowledge is the king of secrets. Ordinary secrets can give us happiness, wealth, power, a competitive advantage and so on, all of which are temporary and limited. But this secret yields eternal, infinite happiness.        Many scriptures described rituals that act as purifiers. They help us eliminate our sins. But this knowledge is the ultimate purifier because it eliminates the sinner, the root cause. As we have seen earlier, our ego creates the sense of doership and enjoyership, resulting in accumulation of merits and sins. But if our sense of doership is eliminated, all of our actions will be spontaneous and in tune with Ishvara\u2019s will. The storehouse of our sins will be burnt away. Plus there will be no question of accumulating merits or sins.        Shri Krishna says that we will be able to immediately perceive or experience this knowledge. When we are a little hungry, we say \u201cI think I am hungry\u201d. But if we have not eaten for a while day, we automatically say \u201cI am hungry\u201d without any further thinking. This is what is meant by immediate and direct perception. There will be zero doubt in this knowledge.        This knowledge is aligned with dharma, the law that holds the universe together. Nowadays, many practices in the business world that were formerly legal are being deemed illegal and vice versa. This happens because they are based on ever-changing laws. But this knowledge is in accordance with the universal law. It holds true at any point in time, anywhere in the world. Moreover, it will always result in joy, never in sorrow.        Finally, this knowledge is easy to perform, it does not require any special attributes in the person other than dedication and faith. While most things that take little effort yield temporary results, this knowledge results in permanent, eternal happiness.        Having provided a detailed description of the characteristics of this royal knowledge, Shri Krishna describes the fate of people who do not follow this teaching."

He begins the chapter by asserting that the knowledge of Ishvara\u2019s infinite nature will result in liberation. He addresses Arjuna as \u201canasooya\u201d which means without fault, doubt or prejudice, indicating that those who have begun the process of purification of their minds through karma yoga and devoted meditation will understand this knowledge completely.        First, let us understand the result of knowledge that Shri Krishna is glorifying in this shloka. It is going to give us freedom or liberation from the inauspicious. The word inauspicious in this shloka refers to samsaara or the endless cycle of creation and dissolution that all of us are trapped in.        Next, let us look at what makes this knowledge unique. Shri Krishna says that he is going to reveal not just knowledge, but also \u201cvijnyana\u201d or wisdom that we can internalize in our lives. Also, unlike other knowledge that requires action to give a result, this knowledge gives us the result of liberation all by itself. As an example, if we come to know that a mirage in a desert is false, we don\u2019t have to do anything further.        What makes this knowledge even more special is that it is extremely subtle. It is hard for someone to figure out on their own. We need a competent teacher like Shri Krishna to reveal this knowledge to you. Shri Krishna, urging us to learn this knowledge in the right way through a teacher, calls it \u201csecret knowledge\u201d.        Shri Krishna further glorifies this special knowledge in the next shloka."

        "content": "In the seventh chapter, Shri Krishna gave a detailed description of Ishvara, and stressed the importance of recognizing the infinite aspect of Ishvara. The eight chapter took a bit of a detour from that topic. In the beginning of this chapter, Arjuna raised seven questions that Shri Krishna answered in this chapter. The key question was : \u201chow does one attain Ishvara after death\u201d which became the main topic of this chapter.        Shri Krishna began this topic by asserting that the thought of the time of death determines our fate. If that thought is of Ishvara, we will attain Ishvara. Since we will not know when our death occurs, he advised us to meditate upon our Ishvara throughout our life so it automatically becomes our final thought. To help us cultivate this thought, Shri Krishna elaborated upon three types of meditation.        The first type of meditation was on the cosmic form of Ishvara and the second type was on the name of Ishvara, which is Om. Both these meditation techniques also required us to exercise control of our praana or life forces. Since this is beyond most of our capabilities, Shri Krishna recommended the third type of meditation which was much simpler. He advised us to remember Ishvara in any form, but do so constantly throughout our life.        So then, what happens when we die? Shri Krishna said that the universe is like an infinite cycle of creation and dissolution, symbolically depicted as the day and night of Lord Brahma. Both day and night are each 4.32 billion years long. At the end of each day of Lord Brahma, all living and non-living beings become unmanifest. When the night of Lord Brahma ends, all those beings are manifest again. In other words, they are \u201cfrozen\u201d at the end of the day and they \u201cthaw\u201d in the beginning of the day. This goes on infinitely.        Having known this, our state is pitiable. We are caught in this endless cycle of creation and dissolution. Only those beings who only put forth the effort come out of this endless cycle. They attain Ishvara transcends this cycle. So, urging us to take steps towards achieving liberation is the refrain of this chapter, and of the Gita as a whole.        Towards the end of the chapter, Shri Krishna enumerated the two paths that a jeeva or soul takes after death. The first path is the dark path which is attained by those who have performed good actions on this earth. They attain the abode of the moon (heaven). After exhausting the results of their actions, they return to this world and are reborn.        The second path is the bright path which is attained by those who have practised devoted meditation on Ishvara in addition to performing good actions. They attain the abode of Lord Brahma and remain there until its dissolution when they are eventually liberation. We are encouraged to take up this path."

He tells us that he has spelled out an entire \u201cflowchart for the afterlife\u201d. With this knowledge, we have the means to achieve anything including heaven, rebirth and liberation. The outcome solely depends upon our behaviour while we are alive.        Traditionally, seekers used the instructions in the Vedas to perform rituals, austerities and charity. Many of them did so with the goal of attaining a better state in the afterlife. In our case, even though we may not perform rituals per se, our goal is similar. We try to do good actions and charity so that we can earn \u201cpunya\u201d or merit for the afterlife. However, we know know that mere performance of good actions will get us to heaven, but we will eventually come back once our merits are exhausted.        Therefore, Shri Krishna recommends the bright path of devotion and action that leads us to the abode of Lord Brahma, and eventually into liberation. This path of graduated liberation, indicated by the phrase \u201csupreme primal state\u201d is also known as \u201ckrama mukti\u201d. One who achieves this path transcends, or goes beyond the results of heaven, because he attains liberation which frees him from finitude.        Shri Krishna is not done yet. There is yet another path of liberation that is his personal favourite.

One category is those who perform good actions as well as single pointed devotion \u2013 they attain the abode of Lord Brahma. The other is those who only perform good actions \u2013 they attain heaven. But absent from this list are those who perform negative actions that harm others and themselves. What happens to them?        Shri Krishna has omitted the path of such people, probably because he assumes that one who is interested in following the path of karma yoga is putting forth effort to eliminate negative and destructive actions from his life. More information on the path taken by such people is provided in the Srimad Bhagavatam.        So then, what is the significance of these two paths to us? This is taken up next."

Each jeeva is allocated one of two paths based on its actions while on this earth. Here, he speaks about the path taken by those who have practiced single-pointed devotion to Ishvara, indicated by the phrase \u201cknowers of brahman\u201d.        It is said that Ishvara has appointed special deities to guide the jeeva to the abode of Lord Brahma after its body has ceased to function. Agni, jyoti, shukla and uttaraayan are symbols that indicate the deities who preside over fire, light, the lunar fortnight and the six month period between winter and summer. The jeeva resides in Lord Brahma\u2019s abode until dissolution, after which it is liberated. In other words, it \u201cattains brahman\u201d.        In India, Uttaraayana is considered highly auspicious. Its beginning is celebrated with the Makar Sankraanti festival. The lunar fortnight of each month is also the time in which most Indian festivals are celebrated including Navaratri and Guru Purnima.        Next, Shri Krishna described the second path that jeevas take after death."

He provides details around the journey of the jeeva after death.        As we have seen earlier, that journey differs from person to person. It is determined solely by two things : how we have acted and how we have thought. In other words, our actions and our thoughts in this life decide what happens in our next life. In this chapter, Shri Krishna has spoken about two kinds of people.        The first category of people are those who perform good actions in their lives. The second category of people are those who are solely devoted to Ishvara, in addition to performing good actions. This is Shri Krishna speaks about two paths in this shloka. Each category travels on a different path after death.        In the next two shlokas, each of these paths is explained in further detail. One path leads to liberation, which means that those who attain this path do not come back, they are not born again. The other path leads to rebirth or return."

The detail around the creation and dissolution of the universe was meant to highlight the notion that only through liberation can we rise above that endless cycle. Shri Krishna gives us the means for liberation as well as the attributes of the goal which is Ishvara.        Shri Krishna says that liberation is obtained through single-pointed devotion to Ishvara. Single-pointed devotion was covered in chapter six. However, here it is meant to include not just devotion but also karma yoga. If the karma yoga aspect is missing, our vaasanaas or latent desires will remain unfulfilled, pulling us back into the cycle of rebirth so that they will be fulfilled.        Now, what is Ishvara\u2019s connection to creation and dissolution? Ultimately, Ishvara is the cause of all creation. But he is not someone who stands outside his creation. The classic example referenced in this context is that of the potter and the pot. The potter creates the pot out of clay, but remains outside the pot, distinct from the pot. Ishvara is not like that. He is like the ocean that creates waves. The waves are pervaded by the ocean and are also included in the ocean. So is the case with Ishvara. Therefore, Ishvara is everywhere (beyond space) andever present (beyond time).        Having conclude the topic of liberation, Shri Krishna begins the last topic of this chapter in the next shloka. He describes the two paths that seekers have to travel through after they pass away."

He also mentions the nature of Ishvara as imperishable, unmanifest and supreme.        With this shloka, we come back to the main theme that began in chapter seven \u2013 Ishvara. After having explained that this universe is subject to cycles of creation and dissolution, and that unless we take effort, we are stuck in this infinite cycle, Shri Krishna reiterates the need for the pursuit of Ishvara as the means of liberation.        So therefore, for the seeker who performs karma yoga and upaasanaa or devotion towards Ishvara attains Ishvara after he has completed his time on earth and in the abode of Lord Brahma. Shri Krishna summarizes the means of attaining Ishvara in the next shloka, which also concludes the topic of liberation from rebirth."

All living and non-living beings go into a state of suspended animation for 4.32 billion years, after which they come back into manifest mode for another 4.32 billion years. But there is one more thing. There are a select few beings that escape this endless cycle. They are the ones who are liberated.        Let us go back to our example of the movie projector where the light that illuminates the film strip identified itself with a character in the movie. How does that piece of light get liberated? By knowing that the identification with the movie character is false, and the identification with the light is real. The light in the projector remains constant regardless of how many times the movie is shown and rewound. It transcends the movie.        Similarly, Shri Krishna informs us that there is something beyond this cycle of creation and dissolution, something that transcends time and space. In other words, everything in this world is transitory and will eventually lead to sorrow. Unless we realize that everything that we think will give us happiness is subject to destruction sooner or later, we will never become aware that there is something beyond our materialistic pursuits.        So, what exactly is this \u201canother unmanifest\u201d? This is taken up next."

Now, Shri Krishna elaborates on the dissolution aspect. He says that all those beings go into an unmanifest or \u201cfrozen\u201d state during the night of Lord Brahma. The very same beings become manifest or \u201cun-frozen\u201d again, when the day of Lord Brahma begins.        As we saw earlier, nothing is ever created or destroyed. The very same set of beings becomes manifest and unmanifest. The total number of \u201cbeings\u201d in the universe remains the same. Those who die are \u201cborn\u201d into a different form. Forms change but the total amount of universal \u201cstuff\u201d remains the same. It is said that there are 8.4 million species, which are nothing but forms. The movie ends, the reel is rewound, and it begins all over again, on and on, without any end in sight.        Now, here is one word in this shloka that deserves further attention. It is \u201cavashaha\u201d which means helplessly. Shri Krishna says that all beings, even if they are plants, animals, minerals or humans are helplessly stuck in this wheel of birth and rebirth, otherwise known as the wheel of samsaara. If they do not actively pursue a spiritual path, whatever that path may be, they will never come out of this cycle.        Most of us get frustrated if we get stuck in an elevator for more than a few minutes. Imagine how frustrated we should get if we find out that we are stuck somewhere for an infinite amount of time. So how exactly do we escape from this situation? We shall see in the next shloka."

When the day of Lord Brahma begins, the entire universe comprising all living and non-living entities wakes up and begins to act. This process continues until the end of his day. Then, the whole universe goes back into the same unmanifest state that it sprung from. Alternatively, the whole universe is born out of Lord Brahma (the unmanifest), and goes back into him.        We can understand this shloka using the analogy of the movie theatre from the beginning of this shloka. The entire animated movie lies unmanifest in the reel of film. When the movie begins, someone loads the film into the projector and turns the projector on. Then, the bright white movie screen comes alive with all the characters in the movie. When the reel of film ends, all the movie characters are \u201cdissolved\u201d from the white screen. This process is repeated next time, and so on and so forth.        Now let us examine the implications. The universe is never really destroyed. It goes into a state of suspended animation, only to be \u201cun-frozen\u201d when the next day of Lord Brahma begins. This is consistent with the law of conservation of energy and matter. Neither energy nor matter is created or destroyed. They just transform from one state to another.        If we know this, and if we also know that every action that we perform always yields a result sooner or later, we realize that the universe works on a set of well-defined laws. Nothing is random, everything is an effect of some earlier cause. Therefore, we can begin to develop the right set of expectations towards the world. Then, while performing actions in a spirit of karma yoga, we will know that only performance of actions is in our hand. The universe, with its set of in-built laws, will take care of the rest. There is no room for worry.        Now, do the living and non-living being have a choice in this process of creation and dissolution? We shall see in the next shloka."

Before the topic is taken up, Shri Krishna introduces some words here as a way of introduction. The new words introduced here are sahastra and yuga. Although not mentioned explicitly, we shall also look at the four yugas or ages that are part of the cosmic creation: satya yuga, treta yuga, dvaapara yuga and kali yuga.        The cycle of creation is said to begin with satyayuga or the age of truth. It is followed by the treta yuga and the dvaapara yuga. The last yuga is kali yuga or the age of discord, which is the current yuga. Kali yuga is the shortest yuga comprising 432,000 years. Dvaapara is twice that long, treta is thrice that long, and satya yuga is four times that long. Therefore, the total time of creation is ten times 432,000, which is 4.32 million years. This period of creation is also known as chatur-yuga.        Now, having understood the length of chatur yuga, we can calculate the length of Brahma\u2019s day and night. Shri Krishna says that one day of Lord Brahma equals one thousand yugaas. The interpretation of the word yuga here is traditionally taken to mean a chatur-yuga. So then, a day of Brahma equals one thousand times 4.32 million, which is 4.32 billion years. This is also the length of one night of Lord Brahma.        Let us know dig deeper into the symbolic meaning of this shloka. There are two aspects we need to look at. First, this shloka re-emphasizes that every action we perform always bears fruit, but not necessarily in the current lifetime.         We may try and try very hard, but the result of our action may not show up in this lifetime, it may bear fruit in another lifetime. Alternatively, we may sometimes get into situations that we think we do not deserve. These could be favourable situations (an unexpected financial windfall) or unfavourable situations (a natural disaster). These type of results are due to actions we have performed in a prior lifetime.        The second aspect is to do with the cultivation of dispassion or vairagya towards this world. We perform actions in this world not just for immediate gain, but also to leave behind a legacy, leave behind something that future generations will remember us by. It could be wealth, power, prestige and so on. But in effect, Shri Krishna tells us that nothing will last forever. Everything will eventually end, if not now then certainly in 4.32 billion years. So if this is going to be the case, it is better to cultivate dispassion right now so that we can proceed spiritually.        How exactly does the universe come into being and dissolve? This is explained next."

All beings on this earth who perform meritorious deeds go to one of those heavens after death. The abode of Lord Brahma (Brahma-loka) is considered the highest among the heavens. Shri Krishna says that all beings who end up in these heavens, including the world of Lord Brahma, do not stay there permanently. They have to return to earth at some point. Only those who attain Ishvara gain permanent liberation.        The first half of the shloka is applicable to seekers who perform karma yoga diligently and worship Ishvara as well. Depending upon the sincerity of their deeds and worship, they will attain the appropriate heaven. A select few attain the abode of Lord Brahma which is the highest possible heaven. Here, it is said that the residents only enjoy pleasure. There is no sorrow or suffering whatsoever.        Once they attain the abode of Lord Brahma, they are faced with a choice. They can continue to remain interested in pleasure seeking, or attain liberation. Attainment of Ishvara is the same as liberation. If they continue to remain interested in pleasure seeking, if they think of Brahma loka as yet another realm of space and time, they will eventually come back to earth and start life all over again. If they are interested in liberation, they will attain it when Brahma loka is dissolved along with all of the other worlds. This kind of liberation is called \u201ckrama mukti\u201d.

Shri Krishna provides the answer in this shloka. He says that such people do not attain rebirth after they die. They attain something much higher \u2013 they attain Ishvara himself.        First, let us examine how Shri Krishna describes our present condition. Our worldly existence is transient, which means that there is no sense of permanence. Look at our body. It grows from a small baby all the way into adulthood and old age. There is not one moment where it is the same. Similarly, all aspects of our life are impermanent. Therefore, Shri Krishna summarizes our existence in one word \u201cduhkhaalaya\u201d or abode of sorrow. It is a constant quest for happiness through impermanence, which is like trying to hold on to a bubble.        Most people are well entrenched in this pursuit thinking that it is normal. But some have figured out the fallacy in this pursuit and begun their journey towards Ishvara. They are referred to as \u201cmahaatmaas\u201d or esteemed individuals in this shloka. Those who sincerely pursue this path attain the supreme goal : Ishvara himself. If we get Ishvara, we will not get revisit the world ever again. It is like waking up from a dream \u2013 we will not get to go back. So if we hold on to the world, we will never get Ishvara. It is an either/or situation.        So therefore, once we decide that our goal is Ishvara, and develop dispassion or vairagya towards the world, we should diligently pursue karma yoga combined with meditation as prescribed by Shri Krishna in the Gita. Here, Shri Krishna concludes the topic of attainment of Ishvara through meditation. The next topic around creation and dissolution of the universe is taken up next."

He says that no special technique is required. All that is needed is that the seeker focus his mind on Ishvara, perform duties as per his svadharma but think about Ishvara all the time, without interruption.        The key point, however, is the phrase \u201cwithout interruption\u201d. We had seen earlier that there is one thought that all of us have in the back of our minds. For some it is family, for some it is career and so on. It is like the drone of a \u201ctaanpura\u201d in Indian classical music. Shri Krishna says that unless we make Ishvara that constant background thought, we will not attain him. Just performing a 30 minute meditation on Ishvara will not yield anything.        Ishvara is very well aware that most of us do not give him top priority. This is famously depicted in the image of Lord Vitthala, a deity of Lord Vishnu from Maharashtra. He is portrayed as standing with hands on his waist as if to say \u201cI have been waiting here for a long time, when will you come?\u201d This is due to our preoccupation with worldly matters. A deep-seated attraction towards spiritual knowledge, combined with blows from the world, will slowly but surely move the seeker towards constant meditation upon Ishvara.        So therefore, Shri Krishna has provided a simple and straightforward method to attain Ishvara : keep Ishvara as the constant thought but do your duty. It not require us to perform any kind of specialized yogic meditation. What happens when we follow this path? This is taken up next."

Shri Krishna concludes the second technique of meditation, meditation on the name of Ishvara, by saying that one who performs meditation on the sound of Om attains Ishvara during the time of departure.        Like we saw in the previous instance, the symbolic meaning of this shloka also uses death as a metaphor to indicate death of the ego. Therefore, meditation on the sound of Om helps the seeker sever his connection to the finite ego and take him towards the infinite eternal essence.        The key thing, however, is to associate the sound \u201cOm\u201d to our understanding of Ishvara. In other words, meditation on the sound of Om without associating it to our favourite deity will not yield any result. In fact, Adi Shankaraachaarya in his commentary says that meditation on Om should only be performed by one who has diligently heard (\u201cshravana\u201d) and analyzed (\u201cmananam\u201d) the knowledge of the eternal essence. This is why Shri Krishna adds \u201cremember me as Ishvara\u201d to the instruction that we chant Om.        To recap, the first technique was meditation upon the grand cosmic form of Ishvara, and the second technique was meditation upon Om. However, both techniques require us to develop control of our praanaas. Recognizing this, Shri Krishna provides an easier third technique in the next shloka."

He outlines a series of steps which are similar to the detailed analysis of meditation found in the sixth chapter. Four steps are presented here: controlling the organs of sense perception, reducing the number of thoughts to one, directing the life force or praana, and continuing to remain in this state of concentration for an extended period of time.        The first step is to control the organs of sense perception referred to here as \u201cgates\u201d. In meditation, we are advised to select a spot where there is minimal distraction so that the mind does not rush out into the external world towards a sound, image or smell.        The second step is to \u201cconfine the mind within the heart\u201d. This means that we have to slowly reduce the number of thoughts to one thought using japa meditation, for instance. No other thought should enter the mind except the object of meditation.        The third and fourth steps require the oversight and training of an experienced master. For the sake of completeness, let\u2019s examine them anyway. An advanced yogi has the ability to control his praana or life force so that it could be focused in one part of the body. Here, such a yogi is asked to focus his life force in the forehead. Once this happens, the yogi is asked to maintain this position for an extended period of time. Such intense meditation requires tremendous effort and practice.        So then, assuming we are armed with the technique of meditation on Ishvara\u2019s name, what name should we use?

This shloka is written in the style of the Upanishads, and just like the previous shloka, is in a different meter.        Before the actual technique of meditation is described, Shri Krishna highlights the qualifications of the seeker who is about to perform this meditation. He should be free of selfish desires, likes and dislikes, indicated by the word \u201cveetaraagaahaa\u201d. We have already encountered this word under the topic of karma yoga. Strong passions or dislikes become obstacles in meditation as they push the mind to jump from one thought to the other. Only one who has managed to control the mind can perform such meditation.        The seeker should also possess a strong desire to inquire into the knowledge of the eternal essence, indicated by the word \u201cbrahmachaari\u201d. The typical meaning of this word, celibacy, is not used here. It is used to indicate one who \u201cmoves around\u201d or is preoccupied with the study of brahman or the eternal essence. Most of us, however, are preoccupied with actions. We are \u201ckarmachaaris\u201d.  Preoccupation with action will also become an obstacle in meditation, as we have already seen in the sixth chapter.        Endowed with these qualifications, the seeker is ready to meditate upon that which is considered as the ultimate goal: the imperishable Ishvara or \u201caksharam\u201d. What is the process by which one can perform this meditation? This is taken up in the next two shlokas."

At the end of the Mahabharata, many people including Yudhishthira and Draupadi left their bodies using yogic powers. If we interpret this shloka literally, it describes how one can remember Ishvara\u2019s form while voluntarily starting the process of departing the body.        We, of course, do not know anything about such techniques, nor do we wish to pursue it. So therefore, let us examine the symbolic meaning of this shloka. \u201cPrayaana kale\u201d literally means the time of departure or death. Symbolically, it signifies the death of the ego, or the end of our notion of finitude. Therefore, when we rid ourselves of selfish desires, likes and dislikes, and in doing so slay the ego, we automatically develop firm devotion or bhakti towards Ishvara.          As our devotion increases, our mind\u2019s tendency to jump from one thought to the other slows down, settling into the one thought of Ishvara. We can then meditate on the form of Ishvara as the supreme, divine person or parama purusha. All the energy that would normally have been wasted in selfish thinking and action is available to us now. We can channel this reservoir of energy towards meditation.        So therefore, if we use these instructions to develop the daily habit of meditating upon Ishvara, we will naturally and easily remember Ishvara when it is time for us to leave this world. The key thing, of course, is not to forcibly practice meditation, but to gradually ease into it as our level of devotion to Ishvara increases.        With this shloka, Shri Krishna concludes the topic of meditation on Ishvara\u2019s form. The topic of meditation on Ishvara\u2019s name is taken up next."

This is the description of the \u201cparama purusha\u201d, the supreme divine person Ishvara that was referenced in the previous shloka. Note that this shloka has a different meter for added emphasis.        First, Ishvara is described as one who is beyond the notion of space and time. He is \u201ckavi\u201d which means omniscient or all knowing, which is different than the standard meaning of kavi which is poet. There is nothing we can hide from Ishvara because he knows all. He is also \u201cpuraanam\u201d which means ancient and timeless. Kavi means he transcends space, puraanam means he transcends time.        Ishvara is described as \u201canushaasitaaram\u201d, which means one who controls everything, who has final authority over everything. He is also \u201csarvasya dhaataaram\u201d, one who maintains and ordains everything, one who distributes the result of everyone\u2019s actions. In other words, Ishvara comprises the set of laws that hold the entire universe together.        Shri Krishna also cautions us with regard to giving a lot of importance to the visual form of Ishvara. Ishvara is \u201canoraaneeyaamsam\u201d, smaller or subtler than the smallest particle we can comprehend. He is not visible to our senses or to the most powerful of microscopes. He is also \u201cachintya roopam\u201d. His form is incomprehensible. He can never be made into an object, because he is our own self, the subject. By symbolically comparing Ishvara to the sun \u2013 \u201caaditya varnam\u201d \u2013 Shri Krishna indicates that our senses cannot comprehend Ishvara\u2019s brilliance. It is the light that drives away darkness and ignorance \u2013 \u201ctamasa parastah\u201d.        So therefore, we should try to contemplate on this form of Ishvara throughout our lives, so that we can remember this picture during our final moments."

Shri Krishna described three kinds of meditation in the upcoming shlokas.        To perform upaasana, we need the support of either name or form, since it is extremely difficult to meditate upon something that is intangible. In the following three shlokas, Shri Krishna elaborates upon the technique of meditation on form. Here, he recalls the technique that was presented to us in the sixth chapter \u2013 abhyaasa yoga. In this technique, the mind is trained to focus exclusively on one thing. If it diverts to something else, then we bring it back to our object of meditation.        So then, what is the form that we meditate upon? We can meditate upon any form that we have a closeness to. It could be Lord Rama, Krishna, Hanuman or any deity. The deity should come to our mind effortlessly. There is no compulsion to chose one over the other. But as discussed earlier, we should be clear that the deity is an indicator or pointer to Ishvara, the supreme divine person being the words used in this shloka. We should not get stuck at the level of the deity we have chosen.        For those of us who are not so familiar with these deities, we can read scriptures like the Puraanaas that have wonderful stories describing the lives and exploits of these deities. Growing up in India, our generation was fortunate to read Amar Chitra Katha comics that presented these stories in a format that appealed to us as kids. They are available all over the world now.        As we increase our prowess in meditation, our notion of Ishvara also grows. To help us meditate upon Ishvara in all his grandeur, Shri Krishna gives us a pointer to this type of meditation in the next shloka that describes the form of the param purusha, the supreme being."

Since the thought at the time of death determines our fate after death, and the thought of death is an outcome of our lifelong thinking, Shri Krishna instructs us to remember Ishvara at all times and perform our duties.        Let us examine this instruction further. We are not asked to give up our duties, retire to a forest and constantly think of Ishvara there. Shri Krishna wants us to first remember Ishvara, and then perform duty consistent with our svadharma. The result of leading such a life is that we will attain Ishvara certainly. There is no doubt in this matter.        With this instruction, meditation takes on a whole new dimension. Typically, we confine meditation to something that we do for fifteen to thirty minutes, sitting in a solitary place as instructed in the sixth chapter. We now realize that those instructions were meant to prepare us for the kind of meditation that Shri Krishna wants us to pursue: 24/7 meditation of Ishvara.        How can this be possible? Our mind can only think of one thought at a time. So the way to meditate continuously is to somehow understand that everything we see, do and know is Ishvara.        Now we understand why Shri Krishna defined the terms brahma, karma, adhibhuta, adhideva, adhyaatma, adhiyagnya at the beginning of the chapter, because all those are nothing but Ishvara. If, while performing any action, we know that the actor, the action, the instrument, the process and the result \u2013 everything is Ishvara \u2013 we will never forget Ishvara.        Even if this kind of thinking is not possible for us in the beginning, we can emulate the mind of a mother who, regardless of what she is doing, always thinks about her child in the background. By practising meditation on our favourite deity we develop an attachment to it, so that we can recall it every time we feel distant from Ishvara.        So therefore, by practicing meditation constantly on Ishvara, we should strive to change our thinking such that our final thought will be nothing but Ishvara. This constant meditation upon Ishvara is called upaasanaa."

It is said that in his next life, he was born as a deer.               In this shloka, Shri Krishna asserts that whatever we think about at the time of death will determine our fate. But more importantly, he also states that the thought at the time of death is not really something that we can control. It is in fact, an outcome of our pattern of thinking throughout our lives.        If we examine our thoughts over the course of our day, we will notice a great variety of thinking. For most of us it will be a mix of mostly family-related and work-related thoughts, mixed with some thoughts about spirituality. But in the background, we will always have a thought that is going on all the time. It will come to the forefront when we are alone, or when we have opened our eyes after sleeping, but not fully woken up. For King Bharata, that persistent background thought was that of the deer.        So then, our deepest love, our deepest interest and our deepest longing will bear fruit in our next life.

Here, three more questions are answered : what is adhibhootam, what is adhidaiva and what is adhiyagnya. Again, we shall use the running illustration of the projector and the animated movie to better understand the answers.        Let us start with the definition of adhibhootam, which the shloka terms as perishable existence. It refers to everything in the universe that is visible. With regards to our example, it refers to everything in the movie that is visible except Tom. So, for example, if a scene in the movie comprises Tom sitting in a classroom, then everything in the classroom is adhibhoota: his classmates, his teacher, the benches, the windows, the walls and so on.        The one common quality that they share is that they are perishable, they have a beginning and an end. When the movie starts, we come to know that the classroom exists. When the movie ends, the classroom is no more.        Next, let us look at the definition of adhidaiva. Literally, it is defined as \u201cpurusha\u201d or person in the shloka. But what it really means is the creative or intelligent principle that resides within every living and non-living object in universe. It determines the fate of the universe and holds the universe together.        From the perspective of our example, adhidaiva is the movie script. The character Tom may not know why he gets into an accident, or wins an unexpected lottery, but the script knows exactly why it happens, and how it fits into the entire movie. The script determines the fate of the movie. It also ensures that what we see is harmonious and logical, not a random disjointed series of images.        Now, let\u2019s examine what is meant by adhiyagnya. So far we have defined the light that illuminates Tom (adhyaatma), the light that illuminates everything else (adhibhoota), the creative intelligence of the movie (adhidaiva), the mechanism of projection (karma), and the light itself (brahman). But there is one more aspect that is missing in this scheme.        From the minute Tom wakes up in the morning to when he goes to bed at night, he is not idle. He is active in this world. He transacts with his family, his friends, his teachers, even strangers. There is a give-and-take happening throughout the day that compels him to act. Shri Krishna says that this world of activity and relationships is termed as adhiyagnya.          Now we come to the key point. Addressing Arjuna fondly as \u201ceminent among the embodied\u201d, Shri Krishna asserts that adhyaatma, adhidaiva, adhibhoota, karma and adhidaiva are nothing but Ishvara. Ishvara and brahman are the same, it is just that one is with form and one is formless. Similarly, everything that we see on the screen is nothing but a modification of the light of the projector. Whatever Tom does or experiences in the movie is just an illusion. When the film strip stops moving, we see the formless white light on the screen.          Next, Shri Krishna starts answering the seventh question, which makes up the bulk of this chapter."

In this shloka, three questions are answered. We shall use the illustration of the animated character Tom to get an additional perspective on the answers given by Shri Krishna.        First, Shri Krishna answers the question \u201cWhat is that brahman\u201d. He says that brahman is the imperishable, supreme eternal essence that we encountered in the second chapter. In terms of our illustration, brahman is the light in the movie projector that illuminates the film strip. It has no specific shape, qualities or attributes. It is just light. It stands as a witness and is not affected by whatever is happening in the movie. It can exist without the movie, but the movie cannot exist without it.        \u201cWhat is adhyaatma\u201d is answered next. Shri Krishna says that it is svabhaava, or the set of qualities of an individual. Each person in this world has a unique combination of attributes, a unique permutation of sattva, rajas and tamas that is their own. When the universal eternal essence is conditioned or covered by an individual\u2019s attributes, it is known as adhyaatma or aatma.        In the example of the movie projector, karma refers to the portion of light that illuminates the character of Tom. Suppose Tom is wearing a blue outfit and is walking on a green lawn. A portion of the movie projector\u2019s light shines blue on the movie screen. The other portion shines blue. The portion of light that shines blue and thinks that it has its own identity \u2013 that is adhyaatma.        Lastly, Shri Krishna answers the question \u201cWhat is karma\u201d. He says that it is the force that brings about the creation of every entity in this universe. At one level, it is the mechanism in the projector that brings to life the story that lies hidden in the film strip. At another level, it is the animator\u2019s act of drawing the characters in the movie. Essentially, it is the force that converts an unmanifested object into a manifested object.        Similarly, we can say that Ishvara set into motion this entire universe with the one original action that has resulted into the millions and millions of actions that occur in the universe every second. It was the seed of all future actions in the universe. But our ego, our false sense of individuality, comes under the delusion that it is the doer of all actions. Each such individualistic action causes us to further identify with our body, and go further from liberation. Ultimately, like the movie that eventually ends in two hours, everything that is unmanifested will be manifested and will be dissolved, only to start all over again.        Shri Krishna continues with his explanations in the next shloka."

His two questions are as follows. First, he wants to know what is \u201cadhiyagna\u201d and where can it be found. Second, he wants to know how can a yogi or a self-controlled person remember Ishvara at the time of departure. Shri Krishna treats the second question as the most important question. After answering the first six questions in the next two shlokas, Shri Krishna devotes the remainder of the chapter to answering this question only.        Let us continue to develop the illustration of the animated movie so that we can use it in the next shloka when Shri Krishna starts answering Arjuna\u2019s questions. We learned about the animated character \u201cTom\u201d, which is just a series of images on film. The light that illuminated Tom began to think that it has an identity that is different than the rest of the film strip.         As a consequence, the light creates an identity for itself. That light becomes Tom. \u201cHe\u201d is bound by his \u201cbody\u201d, which is nothing but an outline on the strip of film. He also begins to think that he is the \u201cdoer\u201d of an action, and is the \u201cenjoyer\u201d of the result of an action. He thinks that he is walking, talking, interacting with people. He also gets happy or upset over the result of his actions.        So in summary, we have a strip of film that contains a series of images. Each image contains several lines that make up the character Tom that has suddenly begun to think that he is alive. Let us keep this in mind as we begin to hear Shri Krishna\u2019s answers."

Here, Arjuna does a favour to all future students of the Gita by asking Shri Krishna to clearly define these terms. In that regard, Arjuna asks the definition of four terms in this shloka: adhyaatma, karma, adhibhoota and adhidaiva.        This chapter is perhaps one of the more philosophical and esoteric chapters of the Gita. It deals with the theme of life after death, something that has not been addressed so far in the Gita. Furthermore, The definition of the aforementioned technical terms is provided, but has been interpreted differently by various commentators, so we need to chose the most clear and straightforward explanation. We will also get a sweeping glimpse of the Gita\u2019s view on the origin of the cosmos.        To better understand these technical terms, let us set up an illustration. First, let us quickly look at how a movie projector works. A projector consists of a bright light that shines onto a strip of film. This film strip contains a series of images that are shot by a movie camera, or drawn by an animator in case of an animated movie. When the film strip is run through the projector, the images are projected onto the movie screen. The fast speed of the moving images creates the illusion of movement on the screen.        Let us further say that there is an animated movie called \u201cTom\u201d that shows a day in the life of Tom who is a teenager. Tom wakes up, eats breakfast, goes to school, comes back home, plays with his friends and goes to sleep. It is a very simple movie. Like any other animated movie it follows a script written by a scriptwriter, and is in fact a sequence of images drawn by an animator.        Now, here\u2019s where we have to stretch our thinking. Imagine that by some inexplicable magic, the light that shines on Tom on the film strip begins to think that it is different than the light that shines on the other part of the film strip. It develops an identity of its own. It even begins to think that it is actually waking up, going to school and so on.         The light of the projector has identified itself with Tom. What happens next? We will continue to develop this illustration further in the explanation of the next shloka."

        "content": "In the sixth chapter, Shri Krishna elaborated upon the technique of meditation. But one question was left unanswered. What or whom do we meditate upon? Shri Krishna answers that question in this chapter. He urges us to meditate upon him and begins speaking to us as Ishvara.        Before he describes what Ishwara really is, he assures us that we shall know him completely through knowledge combined with wisdom. Just academic knowledge about Ishvara is not sufficient. He adds that those who seek wisdom, which is the vision of Ishvara in his essence, are rare.         Shri Krishna says that there are 2 aspects of Ishvara, the lower and the higher. The lower nature comprises the five elements plus the mind, ego and intellect. The higher nature comprises the life-giving force which is also the experiencer, the subject. Ishvara is the ultimate cause of the universe. As the origin and cause of the universe he pervades all things like a string pervades beads in a necklace. To illustrate, he gives examples of his manifestations or vibhootis \u2013 he is the fragrance in earth and brightness in fire and so on.        So then, what is it that veils Ishvara from us, prevents us from accessing Ishvara? It is his maaya, which is nothing but the three gunaas \u2013 sattva, rajas and tamas. Sattva represents harmony, rajas represents action and tamas represents inertia. These three forces or energies create the entire universe. Only by surrendering to Ishvara can we cross over this maaya, and only a certain kind of person is fit to do so.        According to Shri Krishna, there are two categories of people \u2013 those who perform evil actions and those who perform good actions. The performers of good actions who turn to something that is higher than them are called devotees. Those devotees are further divided into 4 types : the distressed, the inquisitive, the seeker of liberation and the wise. The wise devotee is the dearest to Ishvara because he seeks Ishvara as his own self, seeking nothing else.         But unlike the wise devotee, the other three types of devotees seek Ishvara for something finite. Ishvara is not against this because at the very least it strengthens their faith and weakens their ego, so that one day they can aim for the real deal \u2013 realization of the infinite Ishvara, not a deity that can only provide finite ends. Till that happens, Ishvara delivers the results through those finite deities.        Ishvara\u2019s true nature is beyond maaya, which means he is beyond the three gunaas, beyond our mind and senses, unborn and unchanging. He is beyond space and time. But ever since the beginning of creation, most of us bound by maaya are under the sway of space, time and the three gunaas.          The conclusion is clear. Only those who aspire to realize Ishvara in his true infinite nature, and are ready to do so every moment of their life, will attain Ishvara. Karma yoga purifies our mind to prepare us for this task. But we need to learn the means by which we can gradually train ourselves to go beyond the finite notion of Ishvara. That is the topic of the eighth chapter, which first elaborates upon the technical terms introduced at the end of this chapter."

Each chapter takes us to a higher and higher level of understanding. In this, the final shloka of the seventh chapter, we are taken from the level of the individual to the level of the cosmic. Shri Krishna introduces a topic that all of us have to confront: how should we prepare ourselves for death ?        We cannot begin to answer this question unless we gain an understanding of the cosmos, where did it come from, how is it sustained, where is it going and so on. Therefore, Shri Krishna in the eighth chapter shifts gears to address these questions.         Here, he introduces three additional terms: \u201cadhibhoota\u201d, \u201cadhidaiva\u201d and \u201cadhiyagnya\u201d. These terms along with the 3 terms from the previous shloka will be explained in the beginning of the next chapter. He also says that the wise devotee who has his mind focused on Ishvara realizes or attains Ishvara.         Let\u2019s say we only think of chocolate ice cream for an entire day, non-stop. We do not let any other thought come into our mind. When we wake up the next day, what would be our first thought? Chocolate ice cream, of course. Similarly, Shri Krishna says that whatever we think just before we die shapes our destiny after we die. If we think of something worldly during the time of death, our destiny will be worldly. But if we think of Ishvara during our time of dying, we will attain Ishvara.        Now, although we like to plan our lives to the nth degree, none of us knows when we will die. If that is the case, the thought that is top priority in our minds will become our final thought. If we are worried about our job all the time, that will be our last thought. If we are worried about our family all the time, that will be our last thought. If we are worried about our the state of the world all the time, that will be our last thought.        Therefore, the practical lesson here is that we should learn to direct our attention towards Ishvara while we are performing our duties on this world. How exactly we should do this, as well as how the cosmos came into existence, is the topic of the eighth chapter.        om tatsatiti shrimadbhagavadgitasu upanishadsu brahmavidyayaam yogashastre shrikrishnaarjunasamvade jnyaanavignyaanayogonaamo saptamodhyaahaha || 7 ||"

Shri Krishna says that it is that devotee who is striving. In other words, he is performing karma yoga for purification of his mind and intellect, and has become ready for meditation. But this devotee is not driven by blind faith. He is a jnyaani or wise devotee.        So now, what should the wise devotee have knowledge of?

This delusion further strengthens maaya that prevents us from accessing Ishvara. Having explained the condition of most people who are trapped in this situation, Shri Krishna now describes the people who have come out of maaya. He says that only those who have conducted enough meritorious acts and wiped out their sins acquire the firm resolution to directly access Ishvara.        Let us revisit what exactly is meant here by merits and sins. What is a sin? Any time that our mind and senses drag us into the world, and force us to conduct actions born out of selfish desire, we commit a sin. When this happens again and again, it adds to the moha or delusion that blocks our discrimination or viveka.        Conversely, whenever we perform an unselfish action that is in line with our svadharma or duty, we commit a merit. In doing so, we do not add to the stock of delusion, but in fact purify our mind.         Therefore, Shri Krishna says that only those who perform unselfish actions are fit to approach Ishvara. The message is clear: do your duty because it is the only way to contact Ishvara. Karma yoga, seen from this vantage point, reasserts its importance.        Next, Shri Krishna begins to conclude this chapter by planting the seed of the next chapter in two shlokas. They deal with the fundamental question of our ultimate liberation."

But if someone says \u201cI hate my boss\u201d, we may not admit it but there is satisfaction in expressing hatred as well. It is next to impossible for our mind to think of anything without a tinge of love or hate.        Shri Krishna says that the moment we are born, we are cast into this double or dualistic thinking. We can never think an integrated, holistic thought because we are forced to think is terms of likes and dislikes. We run after a certain object because we like it so much and cannot live without it. We finally acquire it. But once that happens, that we begin to dislike that very object that we could not live without. Ultimately every such pursuit results in sorrow.        So therefore, how do we get rid of our likes and dislikes, and begin to think holistically? Karma yoga is the answer. By relentlessly performing actions for the service of a higher ideal, we eliminate likes and dislikes to a great extent. Every sense organ has a like and dislike for its respective objects. That is an undeniable truth. But whether or not we fuel these likes and dislikes is up to us. Breaking away from the clutches of the sense organs prepares us for piercing the screen of maaya.        Now, if we summarize the shlokas so far, we have the entire problem laid in front of us. Maaya caused by our dualistic disposition blocks us, prevents us from accessing the true nature of Ishvara. Unless we gain this access, we are trapped in samsaara or earthly existence. What should we now do?"

He says that Ishvara does not identify with any one form, therefore he has knowledge of all forms in the past, present or future. In other words, Ishvara transcends time.        Earlier, Shri Krishna had said that Ishvara is like a string that goes through all the beads in a necklace, which is a poetic way of saying that Ishvara is beyond space. So therefore, we can conclude that Ishvara is beyond space and time.        Looking at it differently, we who inhabit the world of three dimensions cannot understand the dimensionless Ishvara. When viewing a live broadcast, we are conscious of the time aspect because we cannot know how the broadcast will end. But if we are viewing a recorded program, we have the ability to go backwards and forwards in time and see all the events regardless of when they took place. Time as a concept ceases to exist if we have that ability.        Similarly, from Ishvara\u2019s standpoint, there is no such thing as the past, present or future, because the concept of time does not exist for him. That is how he can have knowledge of everyone that was alive, is alive and will be alive.        What is the implication for us? The only way to know Ishvara completely is to surrender to him and take refuge in him. This means knowing that we do not have an independent existence or power apart from Ishvara. We need to lose our identity in Ishvara, become one with Ishvara.        Now, if we know that Ishvara alone is the truth, that alone is going to give infinite happiness, why don\u2019t we really strive to know that Ishvara? Why is it that we get stuck here and there?This is answered in the next shloka."

A mental limitation forces people to think of Ishvara as a visible, finite entity. Here, Shri Krishna provides the reason for this mental limitation. He says that Ishvara is hidden from us due to the power of maaya.        Our mind is trained to recognize two things: space and time. We can only see, hear, touch, smell and taste objects in space. We can also perceive changes in those objects, which is nothing but the time aspect. So, we are unable to perceive anything that is beyond space and time. We can say that space and time is maaya, or the three gunaas of prakriti known as sattva, rajas and tamas are maaya.        Shri Krishna says that Ishvara has disguised himself in a dress, as it were, made of maaya. Our senses can perceive only maaya. Therefore, we fail to comprehend Ishvara, who is beyond maaya, just like the light of the sun blinds us from seeing the sun itself. Those who think that only the visible is real and the visible is unreal are called moodha or foolish. They fail to see the real nature of Ishvara which is beyond birth and death.

Due to this constant exposure, we tend to perceive everything in terms of these 5 senses. Ultimately, these senses limit what we can perceive.        Shri Krishna, having described the finite goal-seeking mindset of most people, now clearly articulates the problem that they face. Limited by their finite intellect, limited by the prison of the 5 senses, people tend to view Ishvara as a finite entity. As if this is not unfortunate enough, they get so attached to their favourite deity that they sometimes begin to develop a fanatic attitude \u2013 \u201cmy god is better than your god\u201d and so on. The true Ishvara is beyond all senses. Neither the mind nor our speech can reach it. Ishvara is beyond all names and forms.        But, many of us go to temples to worship deities. Even spiritual masters worship deities. How should we understand this? It is because deities in a temple are indicators or pointers to the infinite. An idol in the shape of a deity helps us focus our attention on the form of the deity. But this focusing of attention on the finite deity is a stepping stone to contemplating the true nature of Ishvara which is infinite, imperishable and supreme.        What is the real reason for the problem pointed out here? Why do most people think of Ishvara in finite terms? This is examined next."

Earlier, Shri Krishna said that there was nothing wrong with pursuing finite goals as long as such devotees eventually involve towards pursuing the infinite.        Why do most devotees contact a deity, someone or something that is higher than them? It is to acquire or obtain a goal that will relieve them of their finitude. Let\u2019s say they worship a deity and manage to obtain the object that they desire. Shri Krishna says that no matter what object is acquired, it will perish at some point. In other words, that object will be time-bound or space-bound. It will make the person happy for a short amount of time, after which he will begin to feel finite and consequently unhappy. The cycle of seeking another finite goal will start all over again.        Devotees who do not see the folly of repeatedly acquiring finite things are termed \u201calpa-medhasaa\u201d or finite-minded by Shri Krishna. They will never be free of sorrow but will manage to suppress it temporarily. They are deprived of the knowledge which indicates the true nature of Ishvara. That is why we should never stop enquiring into the reality of things, and try to look beyond the material world for the real answers to our problems.        Shri Krishna goes on to say that those who worship deities may eventually obtain the favour of the deity, who will shower them with his grace. Though commendable, this outcome will still be futile, because the deity is still a finite entity. Only those who seek the infinite Ishvara will gain infinitude by which their sense of finitude or incompleteness will be taken care of once and for all.        So then, there has to be reason why most people do not seek infinitude. This is taken up next."

We saw this in the previous shlokas. Shri Krishna continues that point here by saying that Ishvara does not object when devotee seeks a finite goal from a finite deity. In fact, he strengthens that devotee\u2019s faith by delivering what the devotee asks of the deity.        Faith is a process that most of us do not fully comprehend. But it is a reality. Even in the medical profession, placebos or pills made of inactive ingredients such as sugar are known to cure patients by sheer power of faith.        So Shri Krishna says that even if a devotee approaches a deity with a finite goal, Ishvara is ready to deliver that goal as long as the devotee\u2019s faith in the deity is strong. By fulfilling finite desires through the lower deities, Ishvara hopes that the devotee will learn to further subdue his ego. One cannot have an increase in faith without a decrease in ego.        As desires are sought with greater and greater faith, and the corresponding desires are fulfilled, the devotee\u2019s faith increases. This process has the potential to result in the spiritual evolution of that devotee. He will evolve from seeking finite goals to seeking the infinite \u2013 Ishvara himself.        This is the ideal state, but it is totally up to the devotee to make that transition. Unfortunately, most devotees get stuck in the pursuit of finite goals, as we shall see in the next shloka."

That is why they worship finite, localized forms of Ishvara in the form of deities such as Ganesha, Saraswati and so on.        So in this shloka, Shri Krishna offers a ray of hope for such devotees. Even if we worship a finite deity with a finite goal, Ishvara will ensure that our finite goals are awarded to us. In doing so, Ishvara will strengthen our faith in that deity.         There is nothing wrong in asking for something finite. All notions of spirituality, no matter how finite the goal, are equally valid. They have the power to lift us from our egoic centre towards the universal.        For example, if we ask Saraswati for success in our exams, it is Ishvara who delivers that success through Saraswati. Saraswati becomes the channel through which Ishvara works. He is the running the whole show, as it were. But more important than the delivery of our desire is faith. Ishvara ensures that our faith in Saraswati is strengthened. It is because there will come a when that faith will be eventually turned towards Ishvara. More about this faith is mentioned next."

He now proceeds to describe the other category of devotees. These devotees feel a sense of incompleteness. They keep looking for finite things such as people, objects and situations to make themselves feel complete. Shri Krishna says that such devotees, compelled by their nature, seek the refuge of finite deities. They do so because their discrimination is usurped by the force of their desires.        First, let us look at what is meant by usurping of knowledge by desires. We have seen the example earlier of a family walking through a shopping mall. The husband and the wife see the exact same shops. Both their intellects give them the same knowledge of objects. In other words, both of them recognize that \u201cthis is a nice outfit\u201d and \u201cthis is an Ipod\u201d. But their behaviour towards these objects will be different due to the difference in their respective desires. The husband will think \u201cI want that Ipod\u201d whereas the wife will think \u201cI want that outfit\u201d.        Now, unlike the wise devotees, such devotees still have not shifted their focus towards the ultimate goal that will give them infinitude \u2013 Ishvara. They still harbour desires for material objects, people and situations that prevents them from contacting the infinite. So then, due to the force of their desires, they look for something finite to give them happiness. To that end, they propitiate deities that will give them their finite objects of desire. They approach Lord Ganesha to remove obstacles in their line of work, for example.        Their situation is no different than a businessman who wants to build a factory. He will have to appease the local minister to get land clearances. He will have to appease the local union leader to ensure the smooth running of his factory. He will have to appease his customers so that they will keep placing orders for his goods. But in doing so, he will have to dance to their tune. He may have to give someone\u2019s son-in-law a job in his factory, and so on and so forth. Similarly, in order to propitiate these deities, we may also have to follow prescribed rites and rituals that are specific to each deity.        Shri Krishna says that even if pursuing limited or finite goals is not the way to go, Ishvara will still demonstrate compassion towards such devotees, indicated by the next shloka."

He treats Ishvara no different than his own self. Here, Shri Krishna emphasizes the fact that such people, who know that the ultimate cause of everything is Ishvara, are extremely rare and exalted. In fact, it has taken them several lives worth of effort to get to this stage.        Let us examine the nature of this effort that has led to this vision of the wise devotee. This effort is of two types \u2013 the dawning of knowledge that there is a single cause behind everything, and the surrender of one\u2019s ego to that single cause or Ishvara. There is no specific order in which these can happen first, but both are necessary. The individual who has gone through so much effort to get to this stage is most certainly rare and privileged.        Now, we need to be careful in how we interpret the second half of this shloka. \u201cVaasudev\u201d means one who resides in all, as well as one in whom everything and everyone resides. In other words, the phrase \u201cVaasudev is everything\u201d denotes \u201cIshvara is everything\u201d. If we get stuck with the image of \u201cVaasudev\u201d, if we forget that Vaasudev is an indicator for the one Ishvara, we will begin to develop a fanatic attitude towards people who worship other deities.        Next, Shri Krishna elaborates on the topic of worship for finite gain."

This is because the wise devotee does not approach Ishvara for something else. He approaches Ishvara to gain only Ishvara and nothing else. Here, Shri Krishna adds another reason for singling out the wise devotee as special. The wise devotee considers Ishvara as his own self and not as another object.        First, let us look at the sense of oneness aspect. What is different between a good friend and an acquaintance? There is always a sense of \u201cotherness\u201d between ourselves and the acquaintance, but there is a sense of oneness with the good friend. We see this in a lot of proverbs: \u201ca friend in need is a friend indeed\u201d, \u201cmy house is your house\u201d on so on. The ultimate closeness with a friend is when we do not see any difference between doing something for ourselves, and doing something for our friend. In other words, we see our friend as our own self.        Similarly, whenever we expect something from God, we are by definition treating him as someone different from our own self. Shri Krishna says that he prefers if we treat him as our own self. Such kind of devotion, where the seeker plants himself in Ishvara day in and day out, and melts his existence into Ishvara\u2019s cosmic existence, is the greatest kind of devotion. This is also known as ekabhakti or advaita, where there is no duality between devotee and Ishvara.        However, the reality is different. Most of us consider Ishvara as different than ourselves. One colourful illustration of this is found in the Hindi phrase \u201cbhee aur hee siddhanta\u201d which means \u201calso philosophy\u201d vs \u201conly philosophy\u201d. In other words, we love material objects and Ishvara \u201calso\u201d. Shri Krishna says that we should love Ishvara \u201conly\u201d and not \u201calso\u201d.        Now, this does not mean that Ishvara gives second class treatment to the other three types of devotees. Shri Krishna says that those other devotees are \u201cudaaraha\u201d or sincere. Ishvara is affectionate towards all of them.        Having pointed out the unique aspects of the wise devotee, Shri Krishna highlights the scarcity of wise devotees in the next shloka."

Now, Shri Krishna says that the wise devotee is special among the four types of devotees. The wise devotee is always striving to be connected with him. Shri Krishna gives the reason for the special nature of this devotee in this and the next shloka.        A wise devotee has gone through a lot of ups and downs in life like anyone else. But he has taken the time to accurately analyze his situation. He has come to the conclusion that no matter what he gains \u2013 a new job, new house, investments and so on \u2013 he is still left with a sense of incompleteness. Unlike the other three types of devotees that seek something finite, he wants to go beyond finite things. In other words, he is seeking infinitude.        Having come to this conclusion, his search for infinitude has culminated in Ishvara. He intuitively knows that it is Ishvara that is going to give him infinitude. He then takes to the path of spirituality from the very early stages: karmayoga for purification of the mind, followed by meditation for single-pointedness of mind, hoping eventually to culminate in attainment of the infinite Ishvara.        There is another reason for the special nature of the wise devotee, which we shall see next."

He loves to categorize and classify knowledge. In the previous shloka, he defined people who are blinded by maaya as \u201cdushkritinaha\u201d \u2013 those who commit wrong or evil actions. Such people cannot contact Ishvara. In this shloka, he adds the second category of people \u2013 those who perform good actions, \u201csukritinaha\u201d. He then further classifies these devotees of Ishvara into four types.        The first type of devotee is the \u201caarta\u201d or the distressed. When such devotees are in trouble, when they have a health condition, when they have a monetary problem, when they are anxious about the result of the final exam, when there is nowhere else to go, they approach Ishvara for help. Usually, such devotees would not have remembered Ishvara if they were well off, if they had no source of affliction. Regardless, Ishvara accepts them as his devotees.        The second type of devotee is the \u201cjignyaasu\u201d or the inquisitive. Such people are seeking knowledge in all of its various aspects: economic knowledge, scientific knowledge, artistic knowledge and even spiritual knowledge. They worship Saraswati as the goddess of knowledge.        The third type of devotee is the \u201carthaarthee\u201d. Many commentators interpret this word as one who is desirous of \u201cartha\u201d, which is profit or material gains. However, if we assume that the four types of devotees are arranged in order of importance, then \u201cartha\u201d could mean \u201cpurushaartha\u201d which comprises dharma, artha, kaama (desire) and moksha (liberation). In other words, such a devotee has realized that he needs to use all his time and resources on this world to attain liberation.        Finally, the fourth type of devotee is the \u201cjnyaani\u201d or the wise one. He is the one who realized that there is nothing other than god. He sees god in everything. Therefore, he does not want god for some other purpose. He wants god and nothing else. There are no other desires or ulterior motives in such a devotee.        Are all four devotees alike? Or is there one in particular that Shri Krishna prefers?"

But, many people fail to follow this instruction. Instead, their wisdom is usurped by maaya. Maaya veils Ishvara, causing people to think that they don\u2019t have to associate with Ishvara. Shri Krishna says that these people are not just deluded or ignorant, they are wretched, they are evil doers and are the lowest among human beings.        First of all, there are people who are somewhat deluded by maaya. They spend their lives running after material objects and possessions because they find joy in doing so. But they do so without causing any harm to anybody. Next, there are people who are even more deluded, who don\u2019t hesitate to break the law in their pursuit of material objects. Finally, there are the worst kind of people who will resort to taking another\u2019s life for their material fulfillment.        Having thus categorized people who are deluded by maaya, Shri Krishna calls their nature \u201caasuri\u201d or devilish. Our goal should not to show up in this category.

If our mind with its senses is attracted to sense objects because of the play of the three gunaas, and if Ishvara is beyond the three gunaas, we need to somehow pierce through gunaas to contact Ishvara. If we cannot do it with our mind with its sense organs, how do we do it? We need some additional help. Shri Krishna says that the only solution is to surrender to Ishvara.   First, let us understand what exactly is preventing us from contacting Ishvara. Shri Krishna says that there is something called maaya is the barrier between us and Ishvara. What exactly is this maaya? It is nothing special, it is the 3 gunaas that saw in the previous shloka. Where is this maaya located? Not too far away. It is in our mind, and we can see its effect daily. Just when we think we are studying Gita and are immune to its effect, we suddenly get an angry thought about a friend or a co-worker. That is maaya. Now if maaya is the moat that blocks access to Ishvara, how do we cross it?   Shri Krishna says that in order to cross over maaya, we have to surrender to Ishvara completely. This type of complete surrender is indicated by the word \u201cprapadyante\u201d in the shloka. It literally means falling down at someone\u2019s feet. To visualize it, imagine that the devotee is holding onto Ishvara\u2019s feet, and also keeping one hand under Ishvara\u2019s feet. With this arrangement, the devotee will not run away from Ishvara, and Ishvara will also not run away from the devotee.   Now, what does surrender mean in practice? As long as we assert ourselves physically, emotionally and intellectually, as long as we emphasize our individuality and assert our ego, we will strengthen maaya. So therefore, we need to de-emphasize our individuality and strengthen our devotion to Ishvara. When we surrender ourselves to Ishvara, we give up the notion that \u201cI do everything\u201d or \u201cI own everything\u201d. It is all Ishvara\u2019s maaya. By distancing ourselves from maaya, we get closer to Ishvara.   Moreover, Shri Krishna says that maaya is divine, which means that it is supported by Ishvara but it has reality on its own. In our lives, however, we still rely on maaya for support. We rely on our savings, friends, family, job, education and so on as our refuge if times get tough. But all this is still the product of maaya. Once we shift our thinking that maaya cannot be a support, we will rely on the cause of maaya for support instead of maaya. And that cause is Ishvara. We can only enjoy bungee jumping when we have a strong rope and support. Similarly, we can enjoy the play of maaya if we have tethered ourselves to Ishvara.   How should we practice this daily? We should continue performing our duties as we saw in the previous chapters. What we should change, however, is our attitude. Whenever we start giving importance worldly things including people, objects and situations, we should train ourselves to shift our attention to Ishvara who is behind everything. But we should not use this to justify all our wrongdoings. As we saw in a previous chapter, prakriti or nature is a self-regulating system. If we do something that is against the laws of nature, it will come back to us as a punishment.   So then, having understood this, why do people not seek Ishvara?"

In theory, if we know this, then we should  be a hundred percent clear about the true nature of Ishvara, which is the objective of this chapter. But there is still more to come. Why is that? It is because there is something in these three gunaas or aspects of nature that prevents us from accessing Ishvara.        Shri Krishna says that most people are deluded or confused about the true nature of Ishvara due to the overpowering effect of the three gunaas. This overpowering effect is our tendency to get carried away by name and form. It is our tendency to judge a book by its cover. We are so dazzled by the diversity of various forms of gold jewellery (the effect) that we fail to recognize that everything is ultimately gold (the cause).        Each gunaa or mode of nature has the ability to overpower us. Imagine a vendor at a vegetable market that has to haggle with his customers in order to turn a profit. A taamasic vendor can resort to any tactic including fraud to dupe unsuspecting customers, and potentially get caught doing so. A raajasic vendor can use fair, but aggressive negotiating tactics with even the shrewdest of his customers, eventually shrinking his customer base to zero. Now, we typically think that a saatvic vendor would follow the correct strategy, but this is not the case. Even saatva can overpower the vendor if he always gives in to the customer\u2019s negotiations and goes into a loss.        Now, let us see what exactly happened with each of the vendors. The taamasic vendor could only see the most tangible thing in front of him \u2013 the crisp note that he can keep in his pocket as soon as the sale is made. He did not have the ability to think one step beyond the note, that he would get caught for fraud.        The raajasic vendor thought one step ahead and knew that he should not resort to anything illegal. But by always focusing on his personal gain, he missed the big picture in that he would eventually lose all his customers.        The saatvic vendor understood the big picture to some extent. But he forgot that he had to support a family at home, and therefore had to strike the right balance of maximizing his profit and making the customer happy.        So what does all this have to do with Ishvara? All three vendors were deluded or overpowered by gunaas. This is because our mind and senses is made up of the very \u201cstuff\u201d of the gunaas, as we saw in a previous shloka in chapter 3. They run after prakriti or nature which is also made up of the gunaas.  We are helpless because our senses and our mind is wired to focus on names and forms, and not the underlying essence or cause. We get so carried away by names and forms that we cannot comprehend that Ishvara who is beyond any name and form, any attribute or modification.        So then, how do we develop this ability to pierce through the three gunaas and understand the real nature of Ishvara? Shri Krishna tackles this topic next."

He also provided a short list containing tangible examples of his glories, which he concluded in the previous shloka. In this shloka, he summarizes this point by saying that the three fundamental aspects of prakriti or nature arise from Ishvara, but are subservient to Ishvara.        Sattva, rajas and tamas are the three aspects of prakriti or nature. A more detailed explanation of these three gunaas or aspects is provided in the 18th chapter. At the internal level, these aspects are the moods of our mind. A taamasic mind is dull, a raajasic mind is active and a saatvic mind is serene. Moreover, a saatvic object or thought is tied to knowledge, a raajasic object or thought is tied to activity and a taamasic thought or object is tied to ignorance, sloth or procrastination.        We see all these three aspects in our personality. The body is taamasic. It likes to be in stasis, it does not like to move. A lot of energy is required to move our bodies. Our limbs and our praanas or physiological processes are raajasic because they embody action and movement. Our mind and intellect are saatvic because they embody knowledge. Later in the Gita, Shri Krishna will classify everything, including desire and faith, into these three classications.        Now, all three aspects of prakriti cannot exist by themselves. Nothing can exist without a base or a support. Shri Krishna says that it is Ishvara who provides existence to these three aspects of prakriti. However, he qualifies that statement by pointing out that they are in Ishvara, but Ishvara is not in them. In other words, Ishvara can exist without the gunaas, but the gunaas cannot exist without Ishvara because they need his support.        What is the implication of this statement? Every object, person or situation that we encounter in this universe is comprised of a permutation of the three gunaas. All three gunaas are supported by Ishvara. Therefore, Ishvara is everywhere, behind every object, person and situation in this universe.        So then, what prevents us from knowing Ishvara? Shri Krishna covers this topic next."

He says that Ishvara is the strength that is free of selfishness and attachment, and the desire that is selfless.        What exactly are desire and attachment? Desire is craving for something that we do not have, and attachment is holding on to something that we already have. Selfish actions generate attachment which binds us to the material world. The more selfishly we act, the further we move away from Ishvara acting through us. Only when we act selflessly does Ishvara act through us. Shri Krishna says that Ishvara is that desire which is not selfish, or which is consistent with one\u2019s duty.        Now, when we begin to act in a selfless manner, we develop an inner strength. Conversely, whenever we act out of selfish desire and attachment, we become weak. In the Mahabharata, the Pandavaas knew that they could not target Drona directly because he was too powerful. Instead, they targeted someone whom he was deeply attached to \u2013 his son Ashwaththaamaa. The more we turn towards Ishvara, the less we get attached to people and worldly objects.        It is our choice whether we act selfishly for our personal gains, or selflessly with a view to benefit a higher ideal. Any action that harmonizes or integrates brings with it the power of the entire universe. Therefore, Shri Krishna says that he is the strength that is free from selfish desire and attachment.        Shri Krishna concludes the topic of his vibhootis with this shloka. A much more in-depth discussion on this topic is found in chapter ten of the Gita."

He continues to give a list of his glories in this shloka, beginning with the statement that he is the eternal seed of all beings. He also addresses Arjuna as Paartha, descendent of King Prithu.        Earlier, Shri Krishna asserted that Ishvara is the cause of everything in the universe. So then, why is he seemingly repeating himself by the statement \u201cI am the eternal seed\u201d? It is to ensure that we gain the correct understanding.        Normally, when any tree grows out of a seed, the seed ceases to exist. In the case of Ishvara, however, the seed is eternal. In other words, the seed is changeless, but the entire content of the universe lies in an unmanifest form in this seed. It manifests itself at various points in the universe\u2019s life span, not just at the beginning. So therefore, we need to learn to recognize the eternal seed and not get carried away or stuck in the level of names and forms.        Next, Shri Krishna urges us to recognize Ishvara in intelligence. We admire intelligent people for their ability to think clearly about complex issues without getting swayed by noise. How is their way of thinking different? A glass of clear water lets through more light than a glass of water that is agitated or clouded by dirt. Similarly, an intelligent person\u2018s mind is less dominated by the sway of emotion, and therefore enables the brilliance of Ishvara to shine through the intellect unhindered. In this manner, Ishvara becomes the intelligence of the intelligent.        Finally, Shri Krishna adds tejas or radiance to his list of vibhootis. This radiance manifests in us when when we are in good physical and mental health, when we have slept well, when we are fit. Also, when someone had earned a lot of wealth through self effort, or has performed selfless service, they also have a certain kind of glow. Shri Krishna says that it is Ishvara manifesting in these illustrious individuals in the form of tejas or radiance."

He now continues to list his glories or vibhootis in this shloka.        No fragrance can be compared to that which arises from the earth after the first shower in the monsoon season in India. You have to experience it yourself. Shri Krishna says that whenever we smell that pleasant fragrance, we should know that it is Ishvara in the form of that fragrance. Furthermore, Shri Shankaraachaarya in his commentary goes on to say that any fragrance is a product of prakriti or nature, and any odour is a product of ignorance or avidya.        Next, if we are asked to imagine that entity which contains the hottest fire, we immediately think of the sun. Even if we intellectually know that there are other stars that are much larger than the sun, we still think of the sun as the brightest and the hottest entity. Shri Krishna says that Ishvara is the heat or brilliance in fire everywhere, including the sun and the stars. In other words, the brilliance of the sun is darkness compared to the brilliance of Ishvara.        We intuitively know that there is a life force or life principle that distinguishes inert objects from plants, animals and humans. Our heart becomes joyful when we see an abundance of this life force, especially in children. Shri Krishna says that it is Ishvara that is the life force or life principle present in all plants, animals and human beings.        Finally, Shri Krishna brings up the topic of tapas or austerity. What is tapas? It is the energy that builds up in our body when we check the movement of our senses and our mind. We notice that whenever we over-indulge in eating, drinking, watching too much TV or partying, we feel drained of all our energy. Conversely, when we control our senses and our mind, we will find an increase in our energy levels. This energy is tapas, and Shri Krishna says that this tapas is Ishvara."

Ishvara is in everything, and everything is in Ishvara \u2013 these statements were proclaimed by Shri Krishna previously. Even if we intellectually understand Ishvara as the ultimate cause, our senses do not literally \u201csee\u201d Ishvara. So then, how do we learn to remember Ishvara at all times?        Shri Krishna helps us in this regard by giving us a list of Ishvara\u2019s vibhootis or glories. He recognizes that our mind tends to see wonder and glory in some aspects of the universe. If we can train ourselves to remember Ishvara whenever we see his glories, it will help us advance towards our goal of learning to see Ishvara everywhere.        The first example of Ishvara\u2019s vibooti is the taste in water. Water is an important part of everyone\u2019s life. Over 60% of our body is made up of water. Shri Krishna says that Ishvara is the taste or essence of water. In other words, Ishvara is what makes water behave like water. So whenever we have a glass of water when we are extremely thirsty, it is Ishvara that is refreshing us. This is a wonderful meditation that we can practice.        Similarly, whenever we are dazzled by the brilliance of the sun, or the soothing light of the moon, we should remember that it is Ishvara that is providing the brightness or the effulgence. Whenever we hear a sound, we should know that it is Ishvara that provides the ability for sound to travel through air. Moreover, when we read stories about people who selflessly protect their country or their fellow human beings, we should remember that it is Ishvara that provides valour to them.        Finally, Shri Krishna says that Ishvara represents the word \u201cOm\u201d among the Vedas. Om takes a special place in the Vedas. It symbolically represents the eternal essence out of which this entire universe is created. Meditation on the word \u201cOm\u201d is considered one of the highest meditations possible."

To illustrate this point, he poetically portrayed Ishvara as the womb or the seed of everything, enabling us to develop the vision by which we can see Ishvara in everything. In this shloka, he makes us leap to a whole new level of vision by which we can not just see Ishvara in everything, but see everything in Ishvara.        Shri Krishna addresses Arjuna as the dhananjaya, the conquerer of wealth,  and makes a bold statement. He says that other than Ishvara, there is nothing in this universe. This means Ishvara alone exists in the universe. Other than him, there is nothing else. Through a process that will be taken up in the next topic, we see this universe of names and forms instead of Ishvara.        The shloka provides a necklace as an illustration. This necklace comprises a string and a series of knots in the string, which appear as beads. So, if we were to view this necklace, we would register it as a string and beads. But our intellect would tell us that it is nothing but the string with some modifications in the form of beads.        Similarly, Shri Krishna says that Ishvara pervades the entire universe just like this string pervades the entire necklace. When we apply our intellect, the necklace and the beads disappear, as it were, and only the string remains. Each bead contains the string, but the string contains all the beads. In other words, the string is all-pervading. With the knowledge that Shri Krishna imparts in this chapter, we should strive for piercing through the world of names and forms and only seeing Ishvara.        Is there a practical advantage to viewing the world in this manner? If we can begin to develop this vision, then all our so-called problems with objects, people and situations will disappear, because we will realize that the ultimate cause of everything is Ishvara. If everything is Ishvara, there is no concept of any duality, including joy or sorrow. It is all Ishvara.        Shri Krishna understands that such a vision is hard to develop. Our vision is used to seeing the tangible and not the intangible. So in order to help us in this path, he gives us some pointers that will help us see his glories or vibhootis."

This creation is described poetically as the \u201cwomb\u201d from which everything originates. The lower nature and higher nature are both needed to create this universe. Furthermore, everything that is created is also sustained and ultimately dissolved into Ishvara. In other words, Ishvara creates, maintains and dissolves the entire universe.        Let us now understand the deeper meaning of this shloka. But before we proceed, let us first understand what is meant by cause and effect. When we hold a piece of cloth, what do we see? We see its color, its texture, its shape and so on. But if were to go back in time, we would see that cloth come from cotton threads, which came from a cotton plant, which came from a cotton seed, which at some point came from the earth. So the cause of the cloth was the earth, and the effect is the cloth.        Unfortunately, our minds have been conditioned to focus on the effect, and not on the cause. We see the cloth and its attributes, but do not even think about the cause, because that requires our intellect to come into the picture. Most economic, social and political movements tend to fail because they only focus on the symptoms and not the cause. For example, imprisoning small-time drug dealers does not stop the drug trade, because the demand for drugs will push some other person into dealing drugs.          Now let us look at this shloka from the standpoint of cause and effect. If we were to trace the ultimate cause of anything in this universe, it eventually comes back to Ishvara\u2019s lower and higher natures. Therefore, Shri Krishna is asserting the fact that Ishvara is everywhere. Even though our eyes cannot see the form of a deity in front of us, our intellect will tell us that the ultimate cause is Ishvara. Our eyes give us jnyaanam or knowledge of the effect, our intellect provides us with vijnyaanam, which is the vision of the cause.        In mythology, this intellectual vision is depicted as the \u201cthird eye\u201d of Lord Shiva that turns everything into ashes. This eye is a metaphor for developing equanimity of vision. If we learn to behold Ishvara as the cause of every object that we see, we will automatically begin to see Ishvara everywhere. So therefore, this shloka urges us to exercise our intellect so that we can see Ishvara everywhere.        Seeing Ishvara in everything is a huge milestone in the spiritual path. What is the next milestone?"

Now, he says that those 8 factors comprise the lower, or inferior, type of nature. It is different than the higher or superior nature, that is the life force of the universe. It functions as a force that holds the universe together.        A house is built out of bricks, wood, iron rods and so on. But the building blocks by themselves do not make a house. There has to be an integrating or unifying principle in the form of cement that holds the house together. Shri Krishna says that his higher nature is the cohesive force that upholds the universe. By using the word \u201cjeeva-bhootam\u201d, he is saying that he becomes the universal jeeva or being that makes the universe as a single entity rather than a disjointed chaotic mess.        Furthermore, it is this higher nature that becomes the experiencer of the entire universe as a subject. What does the word \u201csubject\u201d mean? Whenever we see something, two things are required: the subject (one who sees) and the object (that which is seen by the subject). If I see a sofa, then I am the subject, and the sofa is the object. The sofa can never become the subject because it is an inert object. Only conscious entities can become subjects. There is a spark in us, a conscious principle, that enables us to see, hear, touch, taste and smell, in other words, to become a subject.        Throughout our life, we seek knowledge about the world though several sources. But those studies only cover the world of objects, which is indicated here by the term \u201clower nature\u201d. Only spirituality provides us knowledge about the subject, which is nothing but our own self.        So then, why are we talking about subject and object here? It is because Shri Krishna\u2019s lower nature creates the world of objects, and his higher nature creates the world of subjects. When the universe originated, it split, as it were, into two aspects: the lower and the higher nature. The lower nature or prakriti is what we generally describe as the universe that we can see with our eyes and with our telescopes, in both its visible and invisible aspects.        That was the lower nature. The higher nature further split itself into subsets. Each subset became a jeeva, which is the conscious principle operating within each of us. That jeeva principle within us makes us a subject, an experiencer.        Therefore, with these two shlokas, Shri Krishna has covered everything in the world \u2013 subject and object, inert and conscious, experiencer and experienced, building blocks and unifying force. But what is common between them? This is taken up next."

He says that five primordial elements, as well as mind, ego and intellect, comprise his prakriti or nature.        Earth, water, fire, wind and space here do not mean tangible physical elements that we can perceive through our senses. They refer to the qualities of the physical elements. For example, water here refers to the quality of liquids that enable them to flow. Fire refers to the quality of a flame to generate light and heat. When these elements combine with each other, they have the potential to create every object in this universe. In other words, Shri Krishna says that the building blocks of the universe are nothing but his manifestation.        What is the implication here? For many of us that have a set image of Ishvara as a certain deity, this is a whole new way of understanding. It means that Ishvara is within our grasp 24 hours a day, seven days a week. All of the objects, situations and people that we interact with are made up of these elements.        This means that if we realize that everything comes from Ishvara, then we should not have room for any negative emotions such as jealousy, anger etc. Why? When we know that everything is created and owned by Ishvara, we do not get agitated if our neighbour buys a bigger car or gets a better job. We see everything as ultimately belonging to Ishvara, so it does not matter who temporarily claims it as his or hers.        Now, having discussed the five elements, let us take up the other three through an illustration. In the morning, just before we are about to wake up, our mind is in an unmanifest state. We are not aware of anything. As we begin to get up, the first thought that comes to mind is subject awareness, i.e. \u201cI am so-and-so\u201d. Soon after, we begin thinking that \u201cI am so-and-so in this bedroom and it is 7 am now\u201d. The mind goes from unmanifest, to the ego (I am), to awareness of objects.        The creation of the universe per the Saamkhya school of philosphy follows these three stages as well. The universe originally lies in an unmanifest state. The first manifestation or transformation in this state is the ego-principle, which is also known as self-assertion or the \u201cI-principle\u201d. It creates the notion of the subject and object, or of the experiencer and experienced. Finally, this ego-principle learns how to manifest itself in terms of objects, which is known as the cosmic mind. These three states \u2013 unmanifest, ego-principle and cosmic mind are denoted in the shloka as mind, ego and intellect.        The cosmic mind then begins to manifest itself from the most intangible elements to the most tangible ones, step by step. The first element produced is space, which is invisible. Next is air, which we cannot see but can infer from its effects. Next is fire, which we can see but not touch. This is followed by water, which we can see and touch. Finally, earth is produced which is the most tangible element of all. If you reverse the order of elements given in this shloka, it exactly follows the doctrine of creation in Saamkhya.        So, if we take all of these 8 factors into account, we realize that all the material aspects of the universe is Ishvara. Ishvara has not created this world like a sculptor creates statues out of clay. He has created the world out of himself. It is like the spider that creates the web out of himself, like the Mundaka Upanishad says.        The entire world of experience is Ishvara. But what about the experiencer himself? This is taken up in the next shloka."

He also said that by knowing this, nothing else will remain to be known. Given the powerful nature of this knowledge, one would hope that everyone would seek this knowledge rather than running after new sources of knowledge everyday. But this is not the case. Here, he says that those who seek this knowledge are extremely rare in this world.        Let us look at the language used in the shloka. The word \u201csahasra\u201d literally means thousands, but used in this context, it means innumerable or an extremely large quantity. So the shloka then reads: out of innumerable people, only one strives for success in liberation. Out of those few strivers, only one knows Shri Krishna in his essence.        Here, we can raise a doubt and say: what about the millions of people who go the the temple everyday? They worship Ishvara in his numerous forms. Many people observe fasts. Many people have a little temple in their homes. Many people conduct religious ceremonies where they donate food and other items. So how can it be said that only few people know Ishvara?        This doubt can be answered by looking at the last part of the shloka where Shri Krishna says that he has to be known in his essential nature. Most of the people mentioned earlier worship Ishvara, but they tend to have a partial understanding of what Ishvara really is. That is why Shri Krishna devoted almost a third of the Gita in describing his essential nature.        Having introduced the topic of Ishvara, Shri Krishna begins the main portion in the next shloka."

Here, Shri Krishna says that he will reveal not just this knowledge, but also impart us wisdom. The wisdom is such that once we know it, there will be nothing else remaining to be known.        We spend our lives acquiring knowledge about new things. With the pace of change in the world today, we would not be able to know everything, even if we were to spend thousands of lifetimes gaining PhDs in all the sciences, arts, humanities and so on. Shri Krishna says that the wisdom or \u201cvijnyaana\u201d that he is going to impart will be such that once we know it, nothing else will remain to be known.        Let us see how this will be possible. We had seen the example of a goldsmith earlier who is not fascinated by the artwork or shape of the gold bangles, bracelets, necklaces and other ornaments that he comes across. All he cares about is the quantity of gold that is in each ornament. In other words, because he knows the cause as gold, he knows that the effect as the ornament, may differ in shape, but is gold in its essence. Knowledge is the shape of the different ornaments, wisdom is knowledge of their essential nature.        What will happen once I know this? Shri Krishna says that having known this, nothing else will remain to be known. It will be knowledge that is all inclusive. Also, it is knowledge that makes up complete, unlike worldly knowledge that reveals further holes as we study it more.        But if this is the case, why doesn\u2019t everyone pursue this knowledge? This is taken up next.        Footnotes        1.

Arjuna, overcome with sorrow in the battlefield, pleaded to Shri Krishna to give him proper guidance. Shri Krishna proceeded to give him the teaching of the eternal essence, which was the primary topic of the second chapter.        The first step in gaining this supreme knowledge is to purify the mind of selfish desires through karmayoga, which was the topic of the third and fourth chapters. As our desires slowly get purified, karmayoga morphs into karma sanyaasa, where our activities reduce to the bare minimum. The final step is the culmination of karmayoga into dhyaana yoga or meditation. In this manner, the first six chapters of the Gita focus on the individual and self effort.        We saw in the last chapter that Shri Krishna wanted us to meditate upon him as Ishvara. But for the most part, we do not know what Ishvara is, what is his role in the world, how do we access him and so on. Furthermore, if Ishvara truly represents the infinite eternal essence, how can the finite mind meditate on him? Chapters seven through twelve explain this technique. They reveal to us the nature of Ishvara as creator and controller of this universe. And just like we had to put forth effort to purify our mind in the prior six chapter, we need to apply a more demanding approach to understand Ishvara. It is the effort of surrender to Ishvara with bhakti or devotion.        Now, Shri Krishna introduces the seventh chapter with a powerful message. He says that he will reveal that by which we can come to know of Ishvara\u2019s true nature completely and without any doubts. This will require us to develop attachment towards him, and to seek refuge in him.          Firstly, Shri Krishna wants us to understand his true nature \u201csamagram\u201d or completely, and without any doubts. For many of us, our image of Ishvara is based upon pictures we have seen in books or on television of Lord Narayana sleeping on the serpent, or of Shri Krishna playing in Vrindaavan. Shri Krishna says that there is nothing wrong with these images, but that is not the full story. He wants to reveal himself in such a manner to us that we will get a complete and comprehensive understanding of his real nature.        In the process of understanding Ishvara\u2019s true nature, we will begin to develop a strong attachment towards him and become intent on him, indicated by the words \u201cmai aasakta\u201d. When we begin to develop an attachment to a higher ideal, the lower attachments to material things will automatically drop. There is no need for anything else as a source of joy when one develops an affinity for Ishvara.        Furthermore, we will seek his \u201caashraya\u201d, which means support. Usually, when we are in distress, we take the support of our job, our wealth, our body, our friends and so on. But, none of these can guarantee their support. They could pull out any any minute, they are unreliable. As we begin to develop devotion towards Ishvara, we will realize that he is the only permanent support available. We will begin to rely on him solely, rather than on any other source of support.        So therefore, Shri Krishna asks Arjuna to pay attention to this message, as it is not going to be easy for everyone to develop such a connection to Ishvara. But this is the only way by which we can know Ishvara in his entirety. Shri Krishna speaks more about the nature of this knowledge in the next shloka."

        "content": "Meditation, as described in this chapter, is an essential practice in any spiritual journey. Listening and reading scriptures comprises \u201cshravanam\u201d, resolving doubts is \u201cmananam\u201d, and establishing oneself in the knowledge of the eternal essence is \u201cnidhidhyaasana\u201d or internalization. Meditation is the means to internalizing knowledge of the eternal essence.        Shri Krishna gives an exhaustive coverage of meditation in this chapter. The key point for us is to understand the vision of a meditator. The meditator views all objects, people and situations with equanimity. He does not see them as different than himself. In other words, he \u201csees his self in all beings, and all beings in his self\u201d. He can see his self as brahman, the formless aspect of the eternal essence, or as Ishvara, the form-oriented aspect.        In preparing for meditation, Shri Krishna urges us to first renounce selfish desires through karma yoga. Unless the mind is purified of selfish desires for the most past, it will not be able to meditate properly. It is only through the intellect, our higher self, that can control the mind, our lower self. Furthermore, we should lead a moderate lifestyle, in other word not go overboard in eating, sleeping and indulging in sense objects. The end result of all this preparation is a gradual withdrawal or \u201cuparati\u201d from the outside world, leading to the mind settling in the eternal essence, conveyed by the message \u201cthe self settling into the self\u201d.        Next, Shri Krishna covers the technique of meditation. He advises us to select a place that is quiet, clean and pure. He also suggests using a seat that is well insulated, on which we are advised to sit with our eyes focused on one spot, and with our spine held erect. Shri Krishna further instructs us to focus our attention on one thought, and try not to let the mind waver, just like an unwavering candle flame. The object of meditation should be something that we hold as supreme and dear. It could be am image of a deity or of the guru. The untrained mind will always try to wander in different directions, but we should use the power of our intellect, our higher self, to bring the mind back to one thought.        Finally, Shri Krishna praises the meditator by elevating his status higher than any other kind of seeker. He says that the meditator attains supreme joy, peace and bliss. He is always protected against the heaviest of sorrows because he resides in Ishvara. Even if the ultimate goal of meditation is not realized in this birth, the effort put forth will be carried over into the next birth. But the most supreme meditator is one who is Ishvara\u2019s devotee. Who is Ishvara in reality? That is covered in the next six chapters."

Like Arjuna, most of us have worldly duties and responsibilities. Even if we follow Shri Krishna\u2019s advice and take up meditation, we still have to perform actions in the material world. Till we reach a stage in life when meditation becomes our whole and soul, what do we do when we are not meditating to ensure that we continue our spiritual journey? In other words, how do we stay connected to the eternal essence when we are not meditating?        Shri Krishna says that we should develop the highest possible ideal to whom can dedicate all our worldly actions. But this ideal should not just be an intellectual ideal. Unless our hearts are filled with devotion towards this ideal, our attempts will be lacking. But we need to strike a balance. Emotion without intellect results in superstition. Intellect without emotion results in fanaticism. Both are ill-advised. We need a combination of the two. We also need the ideal to be tangible and real, not something that is extremely difficult for our mind to grasp.        Devotion is not exclusive to the spiritual path. Any worldly endeavour requires a combination of action, emotion and intellect. An entrepreneur not just knows what steps he has to take to build a company, but also gets a thrill doing it. A freedom fighter not just knows that freedom is right for their country, but also has reverence for the motherland. A mother loves her children more then she loves herself, but knows when it is time to scold them.        To that end, Shri Krishna urges us worship to the eternal essence in its universal form, which is nothing but Ishvara. We need to begin to develop reverence, and ultimately, whole-hearted devotion to Ishvara. One who develops such devotion to Ishvara that his entire life becomes service and worship of Ishvara, is considered as the foremost yogi or meditator by Shri Krishna.         Therefore, the concluding message of this chapter to Arjuna, and to us, is to develop devotion. Devotion will ensure that we remain connected to Ishvara. In order to do so, we first need to understand who is Ishvara, where is he located, what are his accomplishments, how can we access him and so on. Only then can we truly develop devotion. This shloka is the seed for the topic of the next six chapters, which is bhakti or devotion.        om tatsatiti shrimadbhagavadgitasu upanishadsu brahmavidyayaam yogashastre shrikrishnaarjunasamvade dhyaanayogonaamo shatodhyaahaha || 6 ||"

Having described the need for meditation, the definition of meditation, the process of meditation and the fate of a meditator, he now positions meditation as the ultimate means of attaining liberation. He says that the yogi, or the meditator, is superior to people who practice austerities, work selflessly or study the scriptures. And regardless of how much spiritual progress has been made in prior births, meditation is the only means of liberation. That is why he urges Arjuna to follow the path of meditation.        Here, Shri Krishna first lists three types of spiritual strivers: the taspasvi who practices austerities, the karmayogi who works selflessly, and the jnyaani who studies scriptures. We have come across the term karma yogi earlier, so let us look at the other two. The tapasvi is one who practicies austerities in the form of minimizing exposure to the material world, such as fasting, donating wealth, keeping a vow of silence and so on. The jnyaani is one who is well versed in spiritual knowledge and continues to increase and disseminate this knowledge through books, satsangs or company of holy people, and discourses.        Although each of these practices has their place and moves the seeker forward in his spiritual path, they are will not lead the seeker to his ultimate goal of liberation. Moreover, any of these practices will result in worldy gains as well. Shri Krishna advises Arjuna to not get \u201cstuck\u201d in any of these practices, but to gradually move towards meditation as the conclusion of his spiritual practice. Otherwise, there is a danger of the tapasvi harming himself through extreme austerity, the karmayogi not being able to detach himself from his actions, and the jnyaani gaining a ton of theoretical knowledge but not resulting in anything tangible.        So therefore, Shri Krishna urges Arjuna to follow the path of meditation as prescribed in this chapter. Specifically, this means developing the vision of equanimity or \u201csamyak darshana\u201d, where one sees oneself in all, and all in one\u2019s self. Shri Krishna concludes this chapter in the next shloka."

Such a person, if he puts in diligent effort, acquires spiritual prowess over many lives, purifies his sins, and ultimately attains the ultimate state of liberation.        Now, the plight of someone born into a prosperous family, yet is being pulled towards spirituality, is extremely interesting. On one hand, his family wealth has the potential for generating further selfish desires. One the other hand, the push towards the spiritual path has the potential of taking him towards liberation. What will decide his fate in regards to which side he ends up on? It is nothing but his effort and his diligence.        Therefore, Shri Krishna encourages Arjuna to relentlessly pursue this path. Arjuna is born into one of the most illustrious families of his time. But through the knowledge that he is receiving from Shri Krishna, he has the option of pursuing the spiritual path, but only if he incorporates this teaching into his life.        How exactly should he incorporate it into his life? That is taken up next."

Here, he describes the fate of the other type of unfulfilled meditator who is born into a prosperous family. Shri Krishna says that even though such a person will indulge in sense pleasures, his previous efforts will push him towards rekindling his spiritual journey. This attraction or push towards spirituality will give him the potential of transcending his material pleasures.        Karma yoga teaches us how to conduct our life without gathering impressions or samskaaraas that give rise to further selfish desires. These impressions, if not destroyed, are carried over from one life into the next, and result in activation of further selfish desires. The unfulfilled meditator who is born into a prosperous family is compelled to fulfill all of his desires because this family has enough wealth for him to do so. He is \u201cavashaha\u201d or helpless in this regard ,due to his propensity for desires.        However, in addition to his propensities being carried forward into his new life, his spiritual efforts are also carried forward. At some point in his life, these propensities will manifest in the form of an involuntary push or attraction towards spirituality. Just like the seeker born into a yogic family is pulled, this seeker will also find himself pulled, as it were, towards satsangs, discourses and gurus. But unlike the other type of seeker who knows exactly what to do in this situation, this seeker may not know what or why this attraction happens.        Shri Krishna further says that this pull towards spiritual has the potential to take him out of his current state of indulgence in material pleasures. We have seen that engaging selfishly in the material world further ensnares us in the cycle of karma or action and reaction, which is given in the Vedas, referred here as \u201cshabda-brahman\u201d or the words of brahman. But it is only through determination and effort that this seeker can transcend the cycle of karma. However, if he indulges in selfish desires, he will stray from the spiritual path.        So therefore, it is incumbent upon all spiritual seekers to continuously strive towards attaining their spiritual goals, no matter what their history is. Shri Krishna speaks more about this determination and effort in the next shloka."

He said that the ones that harbour desires will be born into a wealthy family, and the ones that have no desires are born into a family of accomplished meditators or yogis. He now says that the ones that are born into the yogic family reconnect with their intellect from their prior birth. In other words, their effort in their previous life does not go to waste.        We see examples of child prodigies, especially in the field of music and science, who achieve expertise in their fields within a few years of being born. Their personality is somehow pre-configured to excel in their chosen field. Such prodigies get the benefit of nature, which is their parents\u2019 genes, and nurture, which is the conducive environment for mastering their field. Similarly, those who are born into a family of meditators get the benefit of nature and nurture.        Such children find themselves attracted to satsangs, bhajans and discourses at a very early age but will not know why they are attracted. Once this happens, they will continue their spiritual journey and begin to strive for liberation automatically. Moreover, their determination will be much stronger than their prior attempt.        These children will not have any attraction for worldly pleasure because they have already experienced pleasures and had their fill. They will not harbour any further material desires. Other people will find it bewildering that these children do not get attracted by things that most children crave.        Now, what happens to the other type of unfulfilled meditator who is born into an illustrious family? Do they also get reconnected to their prior efforts? Shri Krishna speaks about this next."

In this shloka, Shri Krishna talks about another type of unfilled meditators who is born not into a wealthy family but into a family of learned yogis. He also says that such a birth is exceedingly rare.        So far, Shri Krishna has spoken about two types of serious seekers who had a clear understanding of meditation but were unable to attain liberation. The difference between the two types of seekers is the presence or absence of desires. The meditator who still harbours desires is born into a wealthy family.        Desires are the biggest obstacles in meditation. Only when desires are extinguished can serious meditation begin. That is why this category of meditators is given the chance to fulfill his desires in a wealthy family.        The other rarer category of meditator had managed to extinguish his desires, but could not attain liberation because he ran out of time. Since he is not interested in fulfilling any desire, regardless of whether it is heavenly or earthly, he goes straight into a family of yogis after he dies. These yogis are not just accomplished meditators, they also possess \u201cdheemata\u201d or a keen understanding of the scriptures.         Such a family provides a conducive environment for this kind of meditator to continue his progress in meditation. He has enough dispassion in him and therefore does not get affected by the the absence of wealth in this new family. In fact he appreciates it because wealth can become a distraction in the path of meditation.        Now, do both these types of newly-born seekers have to start their journey from scratch? This is taken up by Shri Krishna in the next shloka."

He says that such a meditator attains heaven, and having stayed there for a long period of time, he is born into an illustrious family.        Many of us strive to perform meritorious acts or \u201cpunya\u201d throughout our life, and at the same time try to avoid or minimize demerits or \u201cpaapa\u201d. The difference between paapa and punya determines our fate after death. Those that have an excess of punya go to heaven after death, others go to hell. So Shri Krishna says that one who follows the path of meditation is automatically qualified to access the very same heaven that is attained by people who have performed immeasurable meritorious deeds. He does not have to worry about counting merits and demerits, he just has to continue meditating.        Now, no matter how much pleasure it gives, the stay in heaven is always temporary. Once the allotted time runs out, the unfulfilled meditator will have to come back into the world. But it will not be such a bad thing. He will attain an environment that is conducive for continuing his spiritual journey. Shri Krishna says that such a person will be born into an illustrious family, one that is endowed not only with material wealth but also spiritual prowess.        Why should such a family need to have material wealth? The primary reason for the meditator to remain unfulfilled is that he still carried around traced of material desire. The new family that he is born into will give him the opportunity to get those material desires out of his system. As we have seen earlier, perfect meditation is possible only when material desires are addressed holistically.        Many of us may not be able to digest the notion of heaven and rebirth. In any case, Shri Krishna wants to assure us that the very laws of nature that take care of the meditator while he is alive will ensure that he will be taken care of even after death.        Do all unfulfilled meditators attain this state? Shri Krishna goes into this topic next."

Shri Krishna responds by unequivocally asserting that nothing harmful or distressful will happen to the meditator while he is in this world, or in any other world. In fact, he will attain a better state, both from a material as well as spiritual standpoint.        We have to carefully parse the meaning of Shri Krishna\u2019s words. He is in no way implying that the meditator will somehow attain material success due to his meditation. The common standard for attaining success in our world is wealth, power and fame, none of which is guaranteed as a result of meditation. Shri Krishna wants us to understand is that one who takes up meditation sincerely will automatically develop dispassion towards wealth, power and fame. He will not care whether he attains material success or not. So therefore, a lack of material success will not cause him distress.        But that does not mean that the meditator obtains a pitiable state. In fact, by sincerely practicing mediation, the seeker will be in tune and in harmony with the world. Then the world itself will take care of all the seeker\u2019s needs. This is not an alien concept. When someone is in tune with any organization like one\u2019s family, workplace or school, when that person puts the needs of the organization above his personal and selfish needs, the organization ensures that such a person receives whatever he wants, and also ensures that he does not get into any distress.        Here, Shri Krishna affectionately refers to Arjuna as \u201ctaata\u201d. Usually this word refers to a father or a son. Here, the meaning is in line with the word \u201cdear student\u201d. By using this word, Shri Krishna shows his encouragement and appreciation for the frank and honest question posed by Arjuna.        Next, Shri Krishna addresses the second part of Arjuna\u2019s question, which is : what happens to the meditator when he dies before gaining perfection in meditation?"

Earlier, Arjuna wanted to know the fate of the seeker who strives hard but does not reach the state of the perfected meditator before he dies. He then added an illustration of the cloud that is helplessly scattered by winds, comparing it to a seeker who achiever neither spiritual nor material success. Arjuna makes a final point in this question by reminding Shri Krishna that only he can answer this question.        By now, Arjuna had come to the conclusion that Shri Krishna was something more than his friend and charioteer. In some shlokas, Shri Krishna even referred to himself as Ishvara. Only one who is beyond the material world can answer a question that transcends the material world, and that is Ishvara himself. Therefore, Arjuna found it fit to ask such a question to Shri Krishna.        The answer to this question is given by Shri Krishna in the upcoming shlokas.

To understand this better, let\u2019s examine a saying in Hindi : \u201cdhobi ka kutta, na ghar kaa na ghaat kaa\u201d. Loosely translated, it refers to a situation where someone has two jobs but because he cannot do either job properly, he loses from both sides in the end.        Arjuna wanted Shri Krishna to tell him whether someone who follows the spiritual path, but is not able to attain fulfillment, ends up in a similar situation. Arjuna uses the analogy of a cloud that neither provides rain, nor does it vanish. This in-between situation makes it an easy target for winds to scatter the cloud from one place to another.        If we were to frame this as an economic problem, Arjuna is speaking about opportunity cost, which is the loss incurred in one activity by spending time in another activity. If the seeker devotes a large amount of his time and effort towards meditation, but fails to attain the desired outcome, is it worth it? He could have very easily have devoted this time to worldly pursuits and obtained wealth, status and thereby secured his worldly position.        Instead, the seeker is \u201cubhaya-vibhrashta\u201d or unsuccessful from both sides. One side is \u201capratishtha\u201d or lack of worldly glory, and the other is \u201cvimoodha brahmana pathi\u201d or distracted in progress on the spiritual path. Arjuna, the pragmatic soldier, does not want to get into such a compromising position. He adds one more element to this question in the next shloka, after which he lets Shri Krishna answer."

Now Arjuna asked another question: what happens when a seeker is striving to meditate faithfully and diligently, but is unable to reach the state of the perfected meditator in his lifetime?        Attaining perfection in meditation is a long and arduous journey. Most seekers start on the spiritual path only after they have established themselves in their careers, which is a late start. Once they have begin, purification of the mind through karma yoga takes time. Hearing and reflection on the scriptures takes still more time. All in all, even if a seeker is sincere, it is going to take a long time to attain the goal of meditation.        Taking this into account, Arjuna formulates his question to Shri Krishna. He gives an example of a seeker who has managed to purify his mind to a great extent, but still has a small amount of desire left. This seeker may have comprehended that his true nature is the eternal essence, but is not able to remain established in that state. So the question is : what happens to such an \u201calmost perfect\u201d seeker?        The honest nature of this question shows to us the candid and open relationship between Arjuna and Shri Krishna. In effect, he is asking his teacher whether or not it is worth pursuing the spiritual path. It is a pragmatic question that many of us fear or fail to ask before pursuing undertakings in the material world, let alone in the spiritual path.        Arjuna further expands upon this question in the next shloka."

In order to emphasize this point, he says that a person who is not in control of his mind cannot ever attain the state of the meditator. Moreover, he advises Arjuna to put forth tons of effort, but do so dexterously and intelligently. Note that he does not issue any edict, he says that this is his opinion, take it or leave it.        Let us first look at the notion of meditation with an uncontrolled mind. Pursuing meditation without first controlling the mind could prove harmful, just like trying to tame a wild elephant by directly mounting it is physically harmful. The wildness of the mind is caused by hordes of desires living in the mind. We may know our conscious desires, but we have no idea of all kinds of desires that are lurking within our subconscious mind, and how powerful they are.        Many meditators think that they have conquered their minds within a few days, and lull themselves into a false sense of accomplishment. Some others get rid of all their material possessions and retire to an ashram. In both cases , they are brought back to reality when one of those desires rears its ugly head and completely overpowers the meditator.        Now, that is exactly why Shri Krishna recommends that our spiritual practice should be practiced intelligently. He uses the word \u201cupaayataha\u201d which is derived from the word \u201cupaaya\u201d meaning solution. It means that spiritual practice requires us to become \u201csolution-oriented\u201d or analytical in our approach. It requires us to focus and pay attention and be aware of each and every desire that lurks in our mind, just like a scientist conducts research in a lab. Simply abandoning all material objects may seem like dispassion, but it will not rid us of latent desires.        With this statement, Shri Krishna answered Arjuna\u2019s question around the difficulty of controlling the mind. Arjuna asks Shri Krishna another question in the next shloka."

This no doubt provided a dose of encouragement to the ever-diligent student Arjuna. By referring to Arjuna as the son of Kunti, Shri Krishna also hinted that a son of such a valiant mother is capable of undertaking the formidable challenge of taming the mind.        Shri Krishna then said that the mind, though hard to restrain, can be controlled through constant discipline and dispassion, it can be controlled. Shri Krishna provided a two-pronged approach to controlling the mind, and in doing so, summarized the entire spiritual technique of the Gita.        When we transition from college to the workplace, we have to learn new ways of doing things, and also, we have to unlearn some habits. Any transition requires learning new ways and dropping old ways. Abhyaasa or discipline is what we have to learn and practice. Materialistic and desire-oriented thinking is what we have to give up or unlearn through the practice of constant dispassion.        First, let us look at abhyaasa or discipline. It is the technique of constant hearing, contemplation and internalization of knowledge (shravanam, mananam and nidhidhyaasana) that reveals our true self. Due to ignorance inherent in the human condition, we forget our true self and think that we are this finite body, mind and intellect. We need to continually hear the knowledge of the eternal essence to remove this ignorance. But even before we can reach a stage where we can hear such knowledge, we first need to clear our mind of impurities in the form of selfish desires, and the notion of doership and enjoyership.        That is why Shri Krishna prescribed the practice of karma yoga in order to first clear the mind of selfish desires. Karma yoga slowly leads to karma sanyaasa, where we slowly give up the notion of doership and enjoyership. Only then will the mind be able to contemplate upon and internalize the knowledge of the self through meditation. This is abhyaasa or constant discipline.        But this is not enough. We have to give up our attachment to people, objects and situations so that our mind stops becoming agitated. This can only happen when we stop and check the mind each time it rushes out into the world, and examine whether we will truly get joy through the object that the target of the mind.         If the mind gets excited when it sees our favourite fried dish, we have to examine whether or not that dish has the capability to give us permanent joy, or whether it sows the seed for future sorrow, perhaps in the form of cholesterol or even indigestion. Such a constant, disciplined investigation automatically brings forth dispassion.        So therefore, with the two-pronged approach of constant discipline and dispassion, we can slowly purge the mind of unwanted desires, leaving room for contemplation and meditation. But what if someone attempts to meditate without controlling the mind? Shri Krishna answers this question in the next shloka."

To control it, I think, is as arduous as the wind.        chanchalam : ficklehi : formanaha : mind iskrishna : O Krishnapramaathi : rebelliousbalavat : strongdrudham : stubborntasya : itaham : Inigraham : controlmanye : thinkvaayoho : the windiva : likesudushkaram : arduous        Arjuna further elaborates on the difficulty of controlling the mind for meditation to Shri Krishna. He says that it is as difficult as trying to harness the wind. Why is that so? The mind is fickle, rebellious, strong and stubborn. It will refuse any attempt to be controlled.        Shri Krishna had acknowledged the fickle nature of the mind in previous shlokas. We oursleves have directly experienced how fickle our mind is. Most of the time, our mind is jumping from one thought to another. Many analogies have been offered to illustrate this fickle nature of the mind. The most common one is a drunken monkey jumping from one branch to another. We can also tell how fickle someone\u2019s mind is by observing their eyes. If they dart around too much, that means their mind is racing through thoughts.        Next, Arjuna says that the mind is \u201cpramaathi\u201d. It is difficult to exactly translate this world. The closest word is \u201crebellious\u201d. It is like a wild horse that is being tamed for the first time. it will never let the rider stay on its back for more than a few seconds. Trying to control the mind becomes a wrestling match where the opponent does not let us get a good grip on him.        Furthermore, Arjuna refers to the mind as strong and stubborn. In other words, once the \u201cmind is made up\u201d, or the mind has decided that it wants a certain thing, it is very hard to change it. It is like a child throwing a tantrum \u2013 it will cry, yell and scream till it gets its way. The mind will resist all efforts to be controlled, and will start creating a list of desires which will throw us completely off track.        So therefore, Arjuna sums up the difficulty of controlling the mind by comparing this endeavour to taming the wind \u2013 something that is next to impossible. Coming from Arjuna, a mighty meditator who is said to have propitiated Lord Shiva through his meditation, makes it a valid question. Shri Krishna responds to Arjuna\u2019s question in the next shloka."

As the discourse concluded, he asked Krishna, the slayer of the demon Madhu, a series of clarifying questions. The first question that Arjuna raised was : how can we remain established in the meditative state, when the mind is so fickle? He then further elaborates on this question in the following shlokas.        Arjuna, being the perfect student, summarized the entire discourse of the sixth chapter in one word: \u201csaamyena\u201d or equanimity. The end goal of meditation is not some magic power or levitation or anything like that. It is the ability to see the eternal essence pervading everything, and thereby develop an attitude of equanimity or sameness towards everything and everyone. This vision reaches its peak when we do not perceive any difference between us and the world, giving us everlasting peace and joy.        But, as Arjuna states, it is difficult for someone to maintain such a vision because the untrained mind will not allow it. It may be possible to develop that vision for a few seconds, maybe for a few minutes, but not more than that. Moreover, it is difficult to see one\u2019s own self in someone we hate or dislike. If we try to see our self in such a person, the mind quickly changes that thought from \u201cI am the self of that person\u201d to \u201che did a bad thing to me last year\u201d.

He also summarizes the entire topic of meditation. He says that one who sees himself in others, and thus experiences their joys and sorrows, becomes a yogi or meditator of the highest caliber.        This is a simple, straightforward and practical teaching that is central tenet of most religions: \u201cdo unto others as you would have them do unto you.\u201d Shri Krishna echoes that golden rule in this shloka. He says that the perfected meditator sees no difference between himself and other beings, just like we do not see differences between our left and right hand, or other parts of the body.        If the meditator sees no difference between himself and other beings, then any negative emotions such as jealousy, hatred, greed and anger go away. When one cannot get angry at one\u2019s right hand or left leg, how one get angry with anyone or anything if all are part of the same \u201cbeing\u201d? In other words, the meditator \u201cputs himself in the other person\u2019s shoes\u201d. He experiences joy when others are happy. He experiences sorrow when others feel sad.        Moreover, one who obtains such a vision will never hurt anyone else physically, mentally or verbally. Such an attitude of non-violence or ahimsa comes naturally to a meditator, since meditation is next to impossible for a person that harbours any kind of hatred or negative emotion towards anyone.        With this shloka, Shri Krishna concludes the topic of meditation. But the chapter is not over yet. In the next shloka, Arjuna raises a doubt that many of us would agree with."

In other words, the devotee does not lose his connection with Ishvara in any and all worldly and spiritual pursuits.        First, let us refer back to our wave and ocean example to understand what is meant by \u201cekatvam\u201d or oneness. If the wave sees himself as part of the ocean, and also sees the other waves as part of the ocean, it ultimately realizes that everything is the ocean. It realizes that there is no separation of wave and ocean, and in doing so, attains oneness with the ocean. Similarly, Shri Krishna says that the yogi who sees all beings in Ishvara, discards any thought of separation from Ishvara. He thus attains oneness with Ishvara.        Here is another example. Let us say that we attend a cricket match where India is playing against some other team. If we sit alongside the Indian team fans, there is no way we can ever forget the India team. Why? Someone will have the Indian team logo on their shirt or on their cap. Someone will be chanting the player\u2019s names. Someone will be holding up cardboard signs. No matter where we look or what we hear, it will be something about the India team. We will see the India team spirit in everyone. There will be no thought of separation from the India team.        Furthermore, Shri Krishna says that the yogi never loses this oneness, it stays with him no matter what transaction he conducts in this world. Many of us have a hands-free headset that lets us stay connected on a phone call regardless of whether we are walking, climbing stairs, shopping and so on. The yogi thus maintains an \u201calways-on\u201d connection with Ishvara. The yogi does not need to go on a pilgrimage or visit any specific temple, because he is always connected to Ishvara.        Now, this does not mean that going to temples or pilgrimages is not encouraged. These places create a conducive environment for the seeker to focus his thoughts on Ishvara, which definitely accelerates the spiritual progress. But the notion that \u201cIshvara is in this object, and nowhere else\u201d is incorrect, it should be discarded.        In his commentary, Shri Shankaraachaaryaji says that for such a yogi, there is nothing that can obstruct his liberation or moksha. He is ever-liberated or nitya-mukta, because he knows that he was never bound in the first place."

He says that the devotee who sees him in everything, and also sees everything in him, will have a permanent connection to him. In other words, Shri Krishna will never appear as distant or invisible to that devotee. It may seem a little confusing to hear this statement right after the previous shloka that said that one should see everything in the eternal essence. How does Ishvara fit into the picture?        Let us refer to our running example of the wave and the ocean. Imagine that a young child sees the ocean for the first time. Her intellect can only grasp visual, grosser objects. So her attention will immediately go towards the ocean, its colour, its size, the sounds it makes, the waves and so on. It will not be obvious to her that everything is water, because she has not reached that intellectual level yet.        Shri Krishna fully knows that most of us are children, even babies, on the spiritual journey. It will take a long time for our intellects to see the eternal essence everywhere. So until our perception stops operating on the level of names and forms, we have to find an easier way to see the eternal essence everywhere.        Therefore, Shri Krishna says that first, we should try to see everything in Ishvara and Ishvara in everything. Ishvara could be the form of Shri Krishna. It could be any other deity that we feel an affinity towards. It could also be our guru. No matter what form we choose, we should be able to view the form of Ishvara as the highest.        Now, most of us have the notion that Ishvara or God is a mysterious figure or force that is sitting far away in Kailash or Vaikuntha or somewhere us. But Shri Krishna, in the Gita, is telling us in this shloka that he is everywhere. It requires a radical shift in order to think this way. That is why in Indian culture, everything can become an object of worship, from a tree to a stone to a book, because Ishvara is present in everything. What is required is the understanding that comes through contemplation.        So therefore, if we truly begin to think that the whole world comprises Ishvara in our chosen form, there will never be a single moment where we are far from Ishvara."

But having come out of meditation, what is the vision of the perfected meditator?        Shri Krishna says that the perfected meditator sees his self in all beings, and all beings in his self. It is difficult to comprehend what this means without actually practising meditation. We can do our best to understand it through an example.        We will use the illustration of the wave and the ocean as our running example. As an individual, we have a name and a form. In the same way, we can assume that each wave in the ocean has a (fictitious) name and form. If we go with this analogy, then we can consider ourself as one of those waves.        Meditation enables us to expand the notion of what a wave is. So first, we begin to see that although there are different kinds of waves in the ocean, in essence, they are nothing but name and form. Some waves are big, some are small. Some last for a few seconds, some last for much longer than that. Now I could be a small wave and you could be a big wave, but both of us are waves nevertheless. It is akin to realizing that we are all in the same family, company, nation and so on.        This stage of the perfected meditator\u2019s vision is indicated by the words \u201che sees his self in all beings\u201d.        As we further expand our vision, we begin to unravel the base of all these waves. We think: yes, all of us are waves, but what holds us together? We then realize that all waves no matter how big or small are contained in the ocean. The ocean is infinitely larger than all of the waves put together. None of the waves can exist without the ocean.        The final stage of this vision is reached when we as the wave realize that the ocean also is a name and form, even though it is infinitely larger than all of the waves put together. At its essence, it is nothing but water. I am the wave is water, other waves are water, the ocean is also water.        This state is indicated by the words \u201che sees all beings in his own self\u201d, and such a person is called \u201csarvatra samadarshanaha\u201d, one with equal vision.        Another point made in this shloka is that this \u201cseeing\u201d does not happen just with one\u2019s eyes. This vision comes out of wisdom. Such vision is sometimes referred to as the \u201cthird eye\u201d. This is the vision of a \u201csthitaprajnya\u201d that was briefly discussed in the second chapter.        This topic is further elaborated upon in the next few shlokas."

He says that one who follows the step by step approach towards meditation obtains infinite joy and happiness because he comes into contact with the eternal essence.        The word \u201devam\u201d here refers to the step-by-step approach to meditation that has been prescribed here. Shri Krishna says that only by following this approach can the eternal essence be realized. There are several methods to meditation, but it is important to follow a disciplined approach in order to obtain the result mentioned in this shloka. It is like the purification of gold. Only a certain process will ensure that the mined gold will shine.        Next, Shri Krishna highlights that the yogi needs to have continually kept focus on the method of meditation with the word \u201cvigata kalmashah\u201d which means without any defects or sins. Meditation cannot yield results if the mind still harbours impurities in the form of vaasanaas and desires. A purified mind is a prerequisite to meditation.        Finally, what does is the end result of meditation? It is ultimate happiness or sukha, obtained by contact with brahman, the eternal essence. The literal translation is : \u201cthe yogi touches brahman\u201d. Brahman is of the nature of infinite joy and bliss. Anyone who identifies with it also gains such infinite joy \u2013 \u201catyanta sukham\u201d.        With this shloka, the explanation of the process of meditation is concluded. We can go much deeper into the process of meditation, discuss further obstacles and so on. Other texts cover those obstacles in greater detail. Next, Shri Krishna illustrates the change in the vision of the meditator, which is the final topic in this chapter on meditation."

He says that supreme joy comes to the meditator whose mind is quiet and free from sin, who has calmed his passions and who has identified with the eternal essence.        What is our situation in life for the most part? We constantly run after sukham or joy. If there is any chance of happiness that is within reach, we run after it. Unfortunately, whenever we run after joy, joy tends to run away from us. It is hard to catch. In the rare instance that we possess joy, we beg it to stay. We do not ever want it to leave us. This is also easier said than done.        Shri Krishna says that in the case of the meditator, it is joy that runs after him. It comes to the meditator and asks him \u201cshall I stay with you?\u201d. The meditator becomes what is sought after, joy becomes the seeker. Moreover, it is not ordinary joy that comes after the meditator. It is the most supreme joy. This is the difference between a bhogi and a yogi. A bhogi runs after joy, but joy runs after a yogi.        Now, how is the mind of such a yogi? It is extremely quiet, like a calm lake. He is able to view any kind of situation that impacts him with such dispassion that it is like watching the situation happen to an unrelated person. If it is a disturbing situation, lets say he suffers an accident, he smiles just like we smile at a character in a movie. There are absolutely no complaints for any situation from a yogi.        Next, Shri Krishna says that the yogi is \u201cshaanta rajasam\u201d, he has silenced the quality of passion within him. Rajas, the mode of nature that causes us to go outside ourself, is present in visible as well as in subtle form inside us. Through karmayoga, we can check the visible forms of rajas to a large extent. But it is only through meditation that we can completely remove the invisible, subtle traces of rajas within us. Till all the rajas is silenced, we should let it express in the form of performance of our duties, not any other actions.        Furthermore, the mind of the meditator is pervaded with a single thought \u201cI am the eternal essence\u201d. This is indicated by the word \u201cbrahmabhootam\u201d in this shloka. When the meditator has identified himself with brahman, and removed his identification with everything else, then he automatically becomes one with the eternal essence. The removal of everything else in the form of impurities is indicated by the word \u201cakalmasham\u201d.        Shri Krishna concludes this topic in the next shloka."

He urges the meditator to check the mind as soon as it strays into another thought, and bring it back to the thought of the self. The meditator has to do this again and again, each time the mind strays. It is one of the most practical shlokas about meditation.        As we practice meditation, we begin to appreciate the speed at which the mind moves from thought to thought. For example, let\u2019s say that the thought of taking a one week vacation enters the mind. It then leads to a chain of thoughts. First the mind makes a list of all our favourite vacations spots. Then it calculates how much each place will cost. Then it visualizes what each of those places looks like. It might also bring up memories of past vacations. The mind has thought all of this within seconds. By the time we are aware that the mind is thinking like this, it has strayed far away from the object of meditation.        So therefore, Shri Krishna urges us to be extremely vigilant and alert with regards to our thoughts during meditation. We have to cultivate this vigilance as a habit. We have vigilant habits in other parts of our life. Men, for example, check their face daily for any stray hairs just after shaving. Similarly, we should be vigilant about stray thoughts during meditation. The constant practice of removing stray thoughts is called \u201cabhyaasa\u201d.        The mind loves to stray towards thoughts about objects, people and situations that we have given importance to. Abhyaasa helps us diminish our importance towards stray thoughts. Shri Shankaraachaarya in his commentary gives us a wonderful tip with regards to abhyaasa. Each time we encounter a stray thought, we should instantly analyze it like a scientist. We should inspect each thought and say: it is nothing but name and form on top of the eternal essence. If the thought is about name and form only, then it is not real, it is does not have \u201csatyatva\u201d. And if it is not real, it is not important, so I should not go after it.        Furthermore, if the very same thought occurs the next time, we should inspect it and say : I have already determined that this thought is not important to me. If we do so each time that same thought comes, we develop dispassion or vairagya towards it. Only then will meditation work properly.        If we follow this technique, the mind will eventually become quiet \u2013 \u201cprashaanta\u201d."

In this shloka, Shri Krishna goes deeper into the topic of focusing attention on one thought. He says that the meditator should use his intellect to withdraw the mind from all material thoughts in order to focus the mind on the one thought : \u201cI am the self\u201d.        In the third chapter, we had encountered the hierarchy of our personality where we saw that the mind is higher than the senses, and the intellect is higher than the mind. What does it mean for the meditator? It means that even though the mind is hard to control, our intellect has the power to rein it in. In other words, the meditator should use the intellect to control the mind.        The mind likes to be busy. It hops from one thought to another at lightning fast speeds. Once we withdraw the mind from the senses, the mind gets restless because it cannot run after sense objects. In order to keep busy, it starts thinking about the past and the future. So therefore, Shri Krishna asks us to use our intellect to rein in the mind. This withdrawal is called \u201cbuddhi uparamet\u201d in the shloka.        How does one do that? Let\u2019s take dieting as an example. Imagine that our doctor has asked us to go on strict diet for 2 weeks. Our first step is to control the senses by not keeping any undesirable food in the house. When this happens, the mind will continuously think about food, and tempt the body to do undesirable things, e.g. go out of the house to get fatty food and so on. The mind becomes agitated and restless, which is a recipe for disaster.        At this point, we use our intellect that has received the doctor\u2019s instructions to check the mind. We think : \u201cI respect the doctor. Therefore, mind, stop contemplating undesirable food since it will have negative consequences for me\u201d. When we think this thought, we can control the mind\u2019s rush into food-related thoughts.        Similarly during meditation, we can withdraw the mind using the intellect. We need to have an intellect that has read and heard about the eternal essence. It understands that any thought other than \u201cI am the self\u201d does not have a place in meditation. Each time an unwanted thought comes, we should use the intellect to gently but firmly shift focus from that thought and put the mind back into the main thought of \u201cI am the self\u201d.        Shri Krishna says that this method could take weeks, months or years. Therefore, he asks us to do it \u201cshanaih shanaih\u201d or slowly slowly, with great fortitude and patience. We should constantly meditate over the thought : \u201c I am the self\u201d. Other than this thought, there should be no other thought. Each time the mind strays, we should not think that we have failed and get dejected. We should again bring the mind back slowly to the one main thought.        When done correctly, we generate a lot of energy will radiate from our personality. This \u201ctapas\u201d or energy was always within us, but used to leak out through our mind and sense organs.        Now, the mind has another issue. It moves from thought to thought with great speed. This is taken up in the next shloka.        Footnotes1. Meditation on the thought that \u201cI am the self\u201d is called \u201csajaatiya vritti\u201d2. Any thought other than \u201cI am the self\u201d is called \u201cvijaatiya vritti\u201d or thought about an object 3. These undesirable thoughts create the notion that \u201cI am not the self, I am the experiencer\u201d4. We have to negate these undesirable thoughts during meditation"

He says that in order to fulfill the goal of keeping the mind established in the self, we have to completely withdraw the mind from all sense objects and tackle desires at their root.        As we have seen in the \u201cladder of fall\u201d in the second chapter, a thought is born as soon as we begin brooding or daydreaming over an object, person or situation towards which we have raaga (attraction) or dvesha (hatred). The more time we spend brooding on the object, the more force is gathered by the thought, just like a snowball gathering momentum.        It is this brooding over objects that we like or hate that has to be checked. Only this restraint will stop desires in their tracks. But to pull this off, we have to follow a multi-pronged approach. First, we have to be aware of our thinking process so that we can stop the brooding the instant it starts. It is just like stopping any phone calls or outside interference when we are in an important meeting. Next, we have to apply this technique to all types of brooding or daydreaming, not just to objects we hate. Finally, we have to constantly examine our likes and dislikes so that we can develop dispassion towards them.        Foremost around \u201cdesire-generators\u201d are sense objects. Our sense organs are programmed to rush towards objects that they like, and rush away from things that they dislike. While they rush, they drag our mind along, causing distraction and agitation. That is why it is advised to meditate in a clean and quiet place so that the sense organs cannot come into contact with anything and distract us. Gradually, as we get more proficient in meditation, we should ensure that the sense organs do not take in strong impressions that can pop up later in meditation. For example, if we love oranges, then we should be careful not to eat an orange just before meditation, otherwise the mind will keep thinking about the orange.        Now, once the mind has been withdrawn from the senses, it will seek an outlet for the outward force that used to rush out towards sense objects. If this force is not provided with a suitable outlet, we will get into trouble. So what should we do with all the latent energy that is stored up? Shri Krishna discusses this point in the next shloka."

Only through meditation can the meditator completely sever all sorrows. He urges the meditator to follow the path of meditation with a firm and unwavering determination. No obstacles should deter the meditator from his goal.        We are introduced to yet another definition of yoga in this shloka. In the second chapter we saw two definitions of yoga: yoga is equanimity, and yoga is dexterity in action. Here, yoga is defined as \u201cduhkha saiyoga viyoga\u201d. Let us examine what this means.        Sorrow has an intimate relationship or connection with our live. We do get glimpses of happiness, but this is due to the degree of sorrow declining temporarily. This connection is termed as \u201cdukha saiyoga\u201d. We never lose this connection with sorrow throughout our life. Shri Krishna says that the yoga of meditation is the only means by which we can sever or separate this connection with sorrow. This is why the yoga is meditation is defined here as \u201cduhkha saiyoga viyoga\u201d.        In other words, if we have perfected ourselves in meditation, sorrows can never touch us. Even though we cannot stop sorrows from approaching us, we will not associate with them ever again after meditation. This capability comes as a result of the fixity of mind developed through meditation. So in addition to progressing in our spiritual journey, meditation gives us something which we continually seek on the material level as well \u2013 freedom from sorrows.        Now, Shri Krishna says something that he has not said anywhere else in the Gita. He says that we must make a firm determination to attain the state of the perfected meditator. He emphasizes that the state of the perfected meditator is the goal that we should aim towards. It is like a parent telling his child that he should focus on obtained his graduate degree. It implies that the child will put effort in school, high school and college, all the way until he gets his graduate degree. If each part of the curriculum is followed, the goal is attained easily.        Similarly, the Gita gives us a curriculum for attainment of liberation. It introduces us to the eternal essence in the second chapter. In the third chapter, it explains the method of giving up the sense of \u201cmine\u201d through karma yoga. In the fourth and fifth chapter, it explains the method of giving up the sense of doership i.e. \u201cI am the doer\u201d through karma sanyaasa. When the sense of I and mine is given up, our mind is then ready to get established in the understanding that the eternal essence is our own self through meditation.        Having said this, Shri Krishna is extremely pragmatic. He knows that this goal is not easy. It is going to take a long time. We will encounter obstacles in the way that may demotivate us or make us despondent and frustrated. So therefore, he says that we should not let the mind become despondent. Each time we encounter an obstacle that pushes us off the path of meditation, we get up and continue, again and again.        What are these obstacles and how to deal with them? This topic is taken up in the next shloka."

The joy of meditation becomes paramount. Also, this joy protects the meditator from the shocks of worldly life. Having gained the joy of meditation, he does not get agitated by any sorrow whatsoever.        As we saw earlier, any joy obtained in the material world is temporary. If someone becomes a manager, he aspires to become a senior manager. Once he becomes a senior manager, he experiences joy for some time, but then he aims for a so-called larger joy: he wants to become a director. And so the cycle continues.        We continually aim for greater and greater joys. In other words, we are always planning for future enjoyment. There will never come a point in life when we can say \u201cyes, now my life is fulfilled\u201d. Shri Krishna says that only meditation will give sense of true fulfillment and everlasting joy, incomparable to any worldly joy that we have experienced. Any worldly joy will pale in comparison to this joy. When one wins a lottery that pays millions, one does not go seeking pennies.        Next, Shri Krishna says that the person who becomes established in this joy of meditation is shielded from the impact of the most troublesome sorrows. Now, attainment of the joy in meditation does not mean that magically, all our sorrows will vanish. Till our human body exists, joy and sorrow will exist as well. But meditation will give us an armour that will protect us from all worldly sorrows. The inner strength provided by meditation will make us \u201cshock proof\u201d.        Let us imagine that we hear extremely disturbing news. What is our reaction typically? Our mind generates thoughts at a breakneck speed. If the sorrow is about a loss of a person, the storehouse of the mind (chitta) generates anxiety-ridded thoughts about the future (what will I do now, how will I survive, how will I adapt etc), memories of the past (it was so nice back in the day when I knew this person), and regrets (I should have done this). These are just a sample of the thousands of thoughts that the mind generates when learning of a disturbing event. For most of us, these thoughts destabilize us. But the meditator\u2019s mind has become \u201cset\u201d in the eternal essence, it never loses its stability.        However, wee have to be careful before we give so much credit to the practice of meditation. Plain meditation without understanding, in other words, meditation without learning the content of the Gita thus far, does not give us this result. But if our intellect has diligently studied about the eternal essence \u2013 that it is beyond birth and death, that it is changeless, that it cannot be destroyed and so on \u2013 and our mind has become established in the eternal essence through meditation, the multitude of thoughts that hit our mind fail to destabilize us. We become like a rock that remains steady in a storm, not the tree that gets uprooted.        So therefore, meditation gives us the best of both worlds. It gives us joy independent of any future sorrow, and also protects us from the impact of heavy sorrows. In the next shloka, Shri Krishna concludes the sub-topic of the joy of meditation"

In this shloka, he elaborates on the nature of that joy. He says that this joy is infinite and is comprehended only by the intellect. Also, he says that once we are established in this joy, no external circumstance will knock us or take us away from this state.        Let us examine the nature of this joy. Shri Krishna says that it is aatyantikam or infinite. Now, the material world is an expert in giving us infinite sorrow. There are moments in our life when the degree of sorrow is low, and we tend to think that this is joy whereas in reality it is just a lower grade of sorrow. Any new object, person or situation that we encounter carries within it the seed for innumerable sorrows. But the joy that one gets from the self is infinite.        Why is the joy from the self infinite? All our worldly joys are dependent on external situations. For some of us, a perfect climate makes us happy, causing us to become sad if the climate changes. For some of us, a certain person makes us happy, so we become dependent on that person and consequently feel sad if that person leaves us. We keep creating subsets in the world: I like A, which means I don\u2019t everything that is not A. But here\u2019s the problem; A is finite and temporary. The joy experienced in the self is independent of all external situations that are temporary in nature. That is why it is infinite.        Another characteristic of this joy is that it is beyond the comprehension of the senses. Just like we cannot catch a satellite TV signal with a regular antenna, our senses cannot catch this joy. It is of a different wavelength altogether. It is only comprehended by our intellect, which operates at a much higher level than our mind and senses.        As an example, consider two teenagers who are at a party where everyone else is enjoying a cigarette. Both of them are offered a cigarette by their friends. The sense organs are reporting the same information to both the teenager\u2019s intellects \u2013 that cigarette smoking is enjoyable and that all their friends are doing it. One teenager accepts the offer and takes a puff. But the other teenager has a refined intellect and it \u201csees\u201d that this will only lead to sorrow in the end. In the same way, the intellect experiences joy that the senses cannot experience.        Shri Krishna further goes on to say that once the perfected meditator is established in this joy, he will never deviate from it. It is like a child learning that 2+2 = 4. Once he has internalized this teaching, it stays with him throughout his life. Similarly, once the perfected meditator realizes this self as his true nature, he will not feel the need to take on any other role or identification for the purpose of fulfillment."

He says that the perfected meditator severs all connections of his mind with material objects, and established a connection to the self or aatmaa during meditation. When the connections with the material objects are severed, he achieves a level of satisfaction never achieved with material objects. The big difference here is that the satisfaction is from within, not from without.        Imagine a 100 watt bulb that is connected to a generator. The generator cannot produce more than 10 watts. Moreover, the generator is defective so even the 10 watts that it produces is intermittent. The bulb will be temporarily satisfied, but will never achieve complete satisfaction. Now, imagine that the bulb finds out that it was inside a power plant all along. When it disconnects itself from the faulty generator, and connects itself to the power plant, it will immediately experience unlimited power. Moreover, this power will be consistent and long-lasting.        Similarly, Shri Krishna says that the satisfaction that our mind achieves from the material world is limited and temporary. The only way to gain unlimited and permanent happiness is to connect our mind to the self or aatmaa. But this happens only when we first disconnect the mind from material objects. The state of the mind when it has disconnected from material objects, and is ready to settle into the self, is called uparamate in the shloka.        Withdrawal from the material world is not easy. It is the outcome of following a disciplined spiritual curriculum. First, we have to develop discrimination or viveka by strengthening our intellect through reading and listening about the eternal essence through scriptures. This enables us to develop dispassion or vairagya towards the material world. Dispassion starts turning the mind away from material objects, leading to withdrawal from the material world. It is like our attitude towards toys versus a child\u2019s attitude \u2013 we have dispassion, the child does not.        So therefore, when the mind has fully turned inward, and has settled into the aatmaa or the self, we experience a deep and lasting level of satisfaction and bliss. But what exactly is meant by the mind settling into the self? It is when the only thought that remains is that \u201cI am the aatmaa\u201d or \u201cI am the eternal essence\u201d. All other thoughts about the world, people, objects, situations and so on have gone away.        Having gained this everlasting bliss and satisfaction, what does the meditator do? Shri Krishna explains this next."

He compares the mind of a meditator to the flame of a lamp that is burning in a windless room. Just like the flame is unwavering due to absence of wind, so too is the mind of a meditator steady due to absence of desire.        If we compare the focused mind to a steady flame, then we need to understand how to prevent to mind from succumbing to the winds of desire. If desires exist, we may be able to temporarily stabilize the mind, but it will eventually get destabilized due to a thought generated by a desire. Presence of desire indicates absence of detachment or vairagya. The only cure is to increase our level of detachment towards the world.        The intense level of detachment that is needed for meditation is not an alien concept. When people get extremely absorbed in watching TV, they temporarily develop detachment towards everything else. If we call them for dinner, or if the doorbell rings and so on, these external occurences do not even register in their minds. It again depends on what we give importance to.        Now let us examine another aspect of the lamp illustration. According to Vedaanta, seeing an inert object is a 2 step process. First, our mind creates a mental picture of the object. Next, the aatman or self shines a light on that picture, just like a torch does. Only when this light is shined do we come to know that \u201cthis is a mango\u201d or \u201cthis is a car\u201d and so on.        But when we meditate on the self, the second step does not happen because we are not focusing our attention on an inert object. We are focusing on the self, which illuminates itself. It is like shining a torch on the sun \u2013 the torch is useless. The self is like the candle since it does not require anything else to illumine it, to shine a light on it. This is another point made in the illustration of the flame.        So therefore, when our focus and concentration reaches its peak, and when the target of meditation becomes our own aatmaa or self, it is the culmination of meditation. It is the state of samaadhi. This state is further elaborated upon in the forthcoming shlokas."

He says that only when one can establish the mind in the self, and not in material objects of the world, is one fit to be called a meditator. There is a lot of depth and meaning in this shloka. The next few shlokas go deeper into its meaning.        For most of us, it is the thoughts about the material world that become the major obstacle in meditation. These thoughts are generated by vaasanaas, which are latent desires and cravings. When we experience or entertain materials object in the mind, we create subtle impressions or vaasanaas in our mind, like a camera, that \u201cthis object/person/situation is good\u201d. The mind then regurgitates these impressions in the form of thoughts. The part of the mind that stores these impressions is also known as the \u201cchitta\u201d.        A desire is a thought that says \u201cI have not experienced something, I want to experience it\u201d. A craving is a thought that says \u201cI already had a good experience, but I want it to experience it again\u201d. It is these 2 types of thoughts that do not allow us to sit down in meditation, because they take the mind outward. Depending on the proclivities of our sense organs, impressions are recorded deeply or superficially. Stronger impressions generate stronger thoughts, pulling the mind outward forcefully.        Shri Krishna says that when the mind has gone beyond generating desires and cravings, only then does proper meditation happen. When the mind gets established in the self, at that time, this person is considered as perfected, integrated and established in meditation. He is fit to be called a yogi. It will only happen with a very well firmly controlled mind, which is pure and free from all kinds of cravings and desires.        Next, let us examine the question of where should the mind be established once it has stopped turning outward. Shri Krishna says that the mind should get established in the aatmaa or the self. But, in an earlier shloka, he had asked us to meditate on his form. What does this mean?        Shri Krishna says that there is no difference. He is our self. In fact, he is the self of all beings. This is the great revelation of the scriptures. If we choose to meditate on his form, that is fine. If we choose to meditate on the formless brahman, the eternal essence, that is fine too. It is usually easier to meditate on the form for beginner seekers. But it is extremely important that we have extreme regard and love towards the Ishta Devata, the form of Ishvara that we chose to meditate on. It could be Vitthala, Rama, Krishna \u2013 any deity. Meditation is not a mechanical activity, it needs uncompromising support from the body, mind and intellect. If the mind does not take pleasure in meditation, it will not happen.        Furthermore, the mind will settle in the self only when we make meditation our top priority. In other words, all other activities in the world should take lower priority. Otherwise, they will show up in meditation. Our job is to do just that. The mind will settle in the self automatically once we do so. It is like a youngster in the house trying to study for an exam while the TV, internet and music system are on. His attention will never go to studying because it is being dragged in several directions. He needs to first switch all the other things off.        Next, Shri Krishna explains the state of a perfect meditator through an illustration."

Previously, he advised the seeker against pursuing extensive austerities using the body. In this shloka, he urges us to lead a well balanced and regulated life so that our body can support our spiritual endeavours. He says that one who has a well regulated diet, exercise, conduct and sleep is fit to become a meditator. Meditation destroys sorrow when one leads a regulated life, but it can very well cause sorrow if one does not.        As we saw earlier, Shri Krishna advises us to monitor the quantity and quality of our food intake. We should be constantly aware of what we are eating, how often we are eating it, what will be the impact on our meditation and so on. On similar lines, the level of daily activity conducted by our body should be appropriate with regards to our health, job and so on. If we lead mostly sedentary lives, then we should undertake the right level of exercise so that meditation does not make the body less active. If we lead very active lives, then we need to ensure that our body is calm and rested when we attempt to meditate.        Furthermore, the quality of our actions also determines success in meditation. If we have the habit of getting into fights with people, we will not be able to meditate properly because the fight will pop up during meditation. Similarly, if we watch a lot of tv or read a lot just before meditation, those inputs will manifest as thoughts and disrupt the meditation. The need to have the appropriate amount of sleep is also re-emphasized.        Broadly speaking, we have to decide what takes priority in our life. If material pursuits take priority, then there always will be excuses and reasons why our meditation cannot happen properly. But if meditation becomes the primary priority, then not only will we progress on the spiritual path, but the well-regulated life that results out of the discipline the we gain becomes a welcome addition."

Shri Krishna, in this shloka and the next one, dispels many of these misconceptions. Alternately, we may go in the other direction and begin to neglect the body. In this regard, he advocates a balanced and moderate lifestyle towards achieving our spiritual goals.        First let us examine the imposition of  severe hardships on the body. Shri Krishna says that meditation will not be easy for one who constantly deprives his body of food and sleep. If the body is deprived of food for a long period of time, where will the mind go when we sit in meditation? It will go to food. The same thing will happen if we forcibly deprive the body of sleep. The minute we close our eyes to meditate, sleep will take over the body. Such hardships become obstacles in meditation.        Before the Buddha achieved enlightenment, he went through a phase where he deprived his body of food. When his body began to look like a skeleton, and when he realized that he was almost about to die of starvation, he came to the conclusion that such severe hardships do not in any way accelerate the process of enlightenment. One cannot torture the very instrument that one uses to attain liberation. Like a perfectly tuned musical instrument, the strings should not be too loose or too tightly wound.        The other extreme is living life improperly by overeating and oversleeping. Besides the health problems associated with overeating, the additional strain put on the digestive system will draw the mind\u2019s attention away from meditation. Where meditation aims to negate association with the body, overeating pulls the meditator back to the body. Also, oversleeping makes the body dull and taamasic. Instead of meditation uplifting the meditator to a higher level of sattva, oversleeping will also pull the meditator down.        So therefore, any deviation from treating the body with care and moderation is not just an obstacle in the spiritual path, it also is an obstacle in any worldly activities. Shri Shankaraachaarya provides a simple formula for moderating our eating habits. He says that one should have a sense of how big one\u2019s appetite is, and then divide it into four parts. Two parts of that appetite should be filled with solid food, one part with liquid and one part should be left empty."

Now, he speaks about the result or the fruit of meditation. He says that meditation, if followed as the technique prescribed here, brings us that peace that yields self-realization.        The journey towards this end goal obviously will take a long time. But there are intermediate results along the way. One who begins to drop attachment and fascination for material objects attains a state of ever-increasing peace. However, this peace does not lead to liberation. It is not \u201cnirvaana paramam\u201d.        Only peace gained by meditating upon the self leads to liberation. Initially, the sense of peace is only present while meditating, but slowly remains with the seeker for longer periods of time. Till the final stage is reached, the person may falter in his journey. Once the final stage is reached, he will never turn back.        Now, what is the source or this peace? Shri Krishna says that it is he who is the source of this peace. One of the fundamental lessons of the Gita is that only the eternal essence can give everlasting bliss and peace. Everything else gives temporary peace. Therefore, Shri Krishna urges the seeker to comprehend this fact and stop going after objects in the material world for happiness and peace."

Once we have made all the physical preparations and are ready to begin meditation, the question comes up: what do we meditate upon? What should be the object of our meditation? Shri Krishna has a simple answer. He says \u2013 meditate upon me. He asks us for two things: to focus our mind on him, and to regard him as the highest goal to be attained.        For beginning seekers, the notion of meditating upon the abstract aatmaa or self is difficult. To that end, he asks the seeker to choose any one form of Ishvara that the seeker takes delight in. Unless the seeker learns to take delight in one form of Ishvara, he will need a lot of effort to focus his mind on Ishvara. The seeker needs to put effort in making Ishvara his goal. This is why Shri Krishna repeatedly urges us to detach from sense pleasure and attach ourselves to something higher. Otherwise, if we love food for example, we will begin to meditate on food since it will be the first thing that pops into our mind when meditating.        What are the other prerequisites of a meditator? His personality or aatmaa is prashaanta. In other words, he is a calm, quiet and deep person. Only when the seeker\u2019s mind becomes extremely quiet is meditation possible. In fact, if the mind is disturbed, even worldly things such as studying for an exam cannot be accomplished. Even though the mind is not quiet throughout the day, the meditator should take care that the mind is quiet at least during meditation time. It will take 10 minutes or so for the mind to calm all its thoughts, hence the meditator should plan on sitting for at least 15-20 minutes.        The next prerequisite is that the meditator should be vigatabheehi which means fearless, one from whom fear has completely gone away. The biggest fear that the meditator harbours is that he will lose his worldly identity, that he will drop his worldly life. That is why the meditator has to have prepared himself, following the instructions given so far, to give up his individuality. Another way of looking at this is that we fear of duality. We are scared to think that we are separate from other people, objects and situations. But one who has learned to see the sameness in everyone has eliminated this fear, because he sees his self in everyone.        Another prerequisite is that the meditator should be established with the vow of renunciation. Colloquially, the word brahmachaari means celibate. Here it means one who casts off all roles and dons the role of a seeker when he sits for meditation. He has no other pursuits in mind, no other roles in mind. He is not someone\u2019s boss, employee, son, husband, brother and so on. If he associates with any of these roles, thoughts associated with that role will enter his mind during meditation. The only role to be assumed is that of a saadhaka or a seeker."

He says that the best posture for meditation is one where the trunk, head and neck are perfectly aligned. Then the focus of attention should be brought to one point in the body. The focus should not be allowed to wander.        Meditation is an inward journey into the self. The means to this journey is to slowly quieten and negate everything else but the self. The first component of the \u201cnot-self\u201d that we have to quieten is our body. So therefore, Shri Krishna tells us to keep our body absolutely firm and steady. Good posture is the best way to achieve this firmness. In this regard, he advises us to align the head, neck and trunk of the body.        For most of us, sitting still in one place and in one posture for even 10-15 minutes is a challenge in itself. Our willpower gets tested. Therefore this is where we should begin. Once we can sit still for 10-15 minutes, we should gradually increase the time to at least 25-30 minutes. If we do nothing else but manage to sit still for 30 minutes, that in itself is a wonderful preparatory step to meditation. The mind will vehemently resist this, but just as we gently but firmly command a child to do their homework, so must we command the mind.        Having brought the body under control, we should then practice focusing our attention so that the mind can be made single-pointed. Shri Krishna says that we should observe the point of our nose and keep our attention there. What is meant here is that we should lock our eyes on a single point. When we sit in one place, our mind either rushes into past memories, or creates future scenarios. Consequently, our eyes follow the mind and start moving. So therefore, we should focus our eyes on one point so that our attention becomes focused as well.        Breath regulation is an important part of any meditative practice. Controlling the breath directly is an effective technique for focusing the mind, but it needs to be learned from a master otherwise it could prove dangerous. Shri Krishna suggests that we subdue our mind and thoughts instead. Since the mind and the breath are connected, the breath automatically will be regulated if the mind is controlled.        So far, Shri Krishna has covered the quietening of the body and breath. Next, he covers the object that is to be meditated upon."

He says that the goal of meditation is to purify the intellect. The process to do that is by sitting down, controlling the mind and senses, and focusing the mind, making it single pointed.        First let us examine the goal of meditation which is the purification of the intellect. The shloka says \u201caatma-vishuddhaye\u201d meaning \u201cself-purification\u201d. Note that the word self means the intellect here. But what does purification of the intellect mean exactly? To understand that, we need to take a step back and examine where meditation is placed with respect to the topics in the Gita. Meditation is the culmination of the entire curriculum of the Gita which aims at removing the three main defects of our personality: mala, vikshepa and aavarana.        In the third chapter of the Gita, we encountered karmayoga. It enables us to purify the first impurity of the personality known as mala or dirt. Mala causes the mind to rush out into the world of sense objects due to a sense of finitude. In other words, it causes us to act in the world. As we have seen earlier, we use karmayoga to turn this defect against itself, just like a thorn removes another thorn. Next, devotion or bhakti is used to remove the second defect known as vikshepa, which the tendency of the mind to get distracted. Chapters 7 to 12 examine bhakti in great detail.        After dealing with mala and vikshepa, the Gita addresses the last defect known as aavarana or covering. This covering prevents us from fully getting established in the knowledge of the eternal essence. Having gone through shravanam (reading and listening to knowledge) and  mananam (removal of doubts), meditation helps us achieve the last step which is nidhidhyaasa or internalization of this knowledge.        So the notion that \u201cI am not this body, I am the eternal essence\u201d needs to be fully internalized so that it becomes second nature to us. This is the goal of meditation.        The process to achieve this goal is also addressed in this shloka. Shri Krishna asks us to sit down on that seat that was described in the previous shloka. He then asks us to make the mind single-pointed or focused. But this is easier said than done. Whenever we close our eyes and sit in meditation, the thoughts of the world rush in.        Many techniques are given in other literature in order to make this happen, including concentrating attention on a point on the wall, on a flame and so on. But the prerequisite to all of this is that we have to subdue the mind and the senses.        Consider the example of the person that wants to remain seated inside a room. Either he will have thoughts of objects outside the room, or someone from the outside will want him to come out of the room. Similarly, when we sit for meditation, either the mind will generate thoughts of the world, or the sense organs will pick up a scent, a touch and so on that will drag the mind out. Therefore, we have to control the mind and senses before attempting meditation.        There also are some secondary benefits to meditation. If we meditate on a regular basis, we will never be reactive to situations. No matter what kind of situation comes up in front of us, we will always take time to pause  and then decide. This is because the mind has already been trained to slow down the thinking process. We will then not lose our balance and not always work in a reactionary mode. We will take a good look at situation and slowly approach itmeditative person will have this advantage.        Next, Shri Krishna delves into the specifics of meditation."

In this shloka, he talks abouthow to sit down and where to sit down for meditation. He says that the seat of meditation should be in a clean and pure place, it should not be too high or too low, and should have sufficient insulation such as a cloth.        First let us look at what is meant by \u201cshuchau deshe\u201d or clean place. The seat of meditation should be placed in a clean and pure location. Some places are naturally clean and pure, and some can be cleaned through one\u2019s effort. Anything that distracts us from meditation becomes an obstacle. If something is dirty, or we are afraid that some insects are around, we cannot do meditation. Preferably, it should be a room or an area of the house where we do not have strong associations. If we meditate in the kitchen, out of habit we will start thinking about food and so on. Therefore, without a clean and pure place, meditation is not possible for beginners.        There is a subtle point made here that merits attention. Why should we sit for meditation? Why cannot we stand or sleep in meditation? Meditation requires the cultivation of saattvic tendencies. It is not possible in sleeping which is a tamasic posture, or in standing which is a raajasic posture. That is why we need to sit. Sitting in one place without doing anything itself becomes difficult for many of us. Hence, that should be our first step.        Next, let\u2019s look at the seat itself. Shri Krishna says that the height of the seat should not be too high so that we are scared of falling down, or too low that insects and other animals can bother us. It should be stable so that we are not distracted by the constant fear of falling down.        Finally, Shri Krishna asks us to put cloth, deer skin and kusha grass on the seat. What is meant here is that there should be a layer of insulation between our body and the seat. The seat could be very cold or hot, which could again become a distraction to the mind.        Having prepared oneself in a seating posture, what should come next? Shri Krishna covers this point in the next shloka."

He says that the main goal of meditation is to absorb our mind into our self or aatmaa. It is not something that we \u201cdo\u201d, but it is a state that we aspire for, just like we do not \u201cdo\u201d sleep. We achieve this state by gaining control over the mind and the body and by dropping off all worldly identifications and expectations. One who practices meditation in such a manner is called a dhyaana yogi.   First, Shri Krishna speaks about the preparation for meditation. He says that that we should sit in a solitary place and should constantly tried to quieten the mind. Why the need for solitary place? Meditation is not a group activity, but ultimately it is an individual activity that is for the yogi alone. It has nothing to do with what other person is doing. Also, it means that we should not depend on anything or anyone for meditation. Some people think that meditation needs a special mat, furniture, tea etc. No external aids are needed.   Furthermore, the solitary place chosen for meditation has to be free from all distraction. It should not occur in a place where there is too much noise. Just like we choose a quiet place when we want to sleep, so too should be the place for meditation. The time we choose for meditation has to be conducive as well. It should not create inconvenience to anyone. If other family members are dependent on you at some time, that is not the right time for meditation.   The notion of \u201cekaaki\u201d or solitude has another aspect. When we sit for meditation, we should drop all other roles and relationships that we identify with such as father, daughter, wife, boss, employee and so on. Otherwise thoughts of family, employees, meetings and so on will pop up during meditation. At least for that period of meditation, we should assume the role of a renunciate or sannyaasi. Usually, meditation is one of the few times in the day when we are not \u201cdoing\u201d anything. If we are not careful, we will worry about things that we normally do not have time to worry about during meditation. So Shri Krishna asks us to be mindful of this.   \u201cYatachittaatmaa\u201d means that the yogi thoroughly has controlled his mind and body through continuous practice of karma yoga. As we saw earlier, Shri Krishna stresses sense control in almost every chapter in the Gita so far. It is probably the biggest qualification for meditation.   Another preparation for the meditator is the quality of \u201cniraasheehi\u201d. It means that the meditator does have any expectations from anything or anyone. Through his own direct observation and analysis of the material world, he has concluded that external things are not going to give him what he is looking for. He has developed the quality of \u201cvairagya\u201d or dispassion.   \u201cAparigraha\u201d is the last quality mentioned in this shloka. Parigraha is storing or hoarding things, so therefore aparigraha means giving up all notions of \u201cmine-ness\u201d, this is mine and so on. The meditator should drop all baggage, in other words he should be free of all thoughts of past and future. It also means that one must give up expectations of any gifts from other people."

He says that regardless of how other people are connected to this person \u2013 they could be friends, enemies and so on \u2013 he views them as alike. Now, having this kind of attitude towards people is far difficult than maintaining such an attitude with objects and situations. So for that reason, Shri Krishna calls such a person \u201csuperior\u201d.   There is diversity of individuals in this world, most of whom we do not deal with, but some of whom we do. By themselves, they are perfectly fine. But when we transact with them, we tend to categorize them through the lens of roles. A wide variety of such roles are provided here by Shri Krishna.   A \u201csuhrida\u201d is well wisher who does not expect anything in return from us, but is intent on doing actions that benefit us. Such people are rare. They do not keep a mental account of the good deeds that they have done, so that we can one day pay them back.   A \u201cmitra\u201d is friend, someone who cares for us. If we call him at midnight and ask for help, he will be there to help us. There is no doubt in our minds about whether or not he will help us. Consequently, we have raaga or desire towards that person.   An \u201cari\u201d is our enemy. For reasons that are justified or even unjustified, we think that such a person wants to trouble us without any reason. We have dvesha or hatred towards this person. This becomes especially troublesome in meditation, because what we hate will come out as thoughts that disturb us in our meditation, not what we love.   \u201cUdaaseena\u201d literally means one who has lifted himself higher. He is indifferent and unbiased towards us and others. We have a neutral attitude towards such a person.   A \u201cmadhyastha\u201d is a mediator. If there are two sets of people, he cares for both parties that could either have something in common, or are even opposed to each other. Such people are known to arrange weddings between two families, or even resolve disputes.   A \u201cdveshya\u201d is a person who we cannot stand. It is not necessary that such a person is our enemy or wishes ill of us. It is someone who irritates us for no reason. Either we wants to pick a fight with us, or we want to pick a fight with them.   A \u201cbandhu\u201d is a relative. It is someone who, whether we like it or not, has a relationship with us due to a familial tie. In fact this word is derived from the word \u201cbandhan\u201d which means tie or knot.   A saadhu is a totally pious and noble person whom we have utmost respect for. The opposite of such a person is a \u201cpaapi\u201d or a sinner, one who has committed great crime.   So therefore, Shri Krishna says that the person whose mental state remains same whenever he thinks of or encounters any of these types of people, he is superior. But to get to this stage first requires a more basic level of sameness when we perform actions. That can only be achieved through karma yoga. Unless the mind is steady while performing actions, we cannot rise to the level of sameness mentioned in this shloka. Our thinking has to change from the ground up.   How does our thinking have to change? Our outlook towards people is usually in terms of gains and losses. We tend to evaluate people by the notion \u201cwhat can they do for me?\u201d. But one who has truly understood law of karma will know that whatever is happening in their life is nothing but a product of their actions. Another way of looking at people is \u201cwhy does not he or she behave like I want?\u201d But that is like asking \u201cwhy is fire hot\u201d or \u201cwhy is salt salty\u201d. People have in-built behaviour that is hard to change.   So, when someone upgrades himself to the karmayoga vision and submits all actions to Ishvara, he leaves all results to Ishvara also. He then begins to view the workings of world as Ishvara\u2019s plan. Regardless of whether he encounters a good or bad situation, person or object, he will say \u201cthis is Ishvara\u2019s plan\u201d or \u201cthis is nature working through its laws\u201d.   Once he has taken himself out of the picture, there no need to hold grudge against any one person, no room for complaint. It makes us become unperturbed and gradually, free of any worries caused by the world. This is how we develop the vision of sameness towards people.   So here, Shri Krishna concludes the topic of the realized meditator\u2019s vision of the world. Next, he introduces the main topic of meditation."

In this shloka, he speaks about how such a person responds to objects. This person\u2019s nature is complete and content with knowledge and wisdom, he has no need for anything else. This contentment and the mastery over senses gives him the quality of steadfastness. He is like an anvil in that regard. He sees sameness in a lump of clay, a stone and gold, such is his vision.   First let us look at what is meant by knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge is that which is gained externally through study of texts. But wisdom comes only when this knowledge has been internalized, and when we can see its application in our life. If someone tells us that exercise is good, then it is knowledge. But if we also come to that conclusion and start exercising, it becomes wisdom. It is like a math problem, we have to work out the answer for ourselves.   Similarly, when we hear that our self is beyond the body, mind and intellect, it is knowledge. But if our body gets a disease, but we think that \u201cI have fallen sick, not my body\u201d, it means that our knowledge has not translated into wisdom. Once I gain wisdom, I do not get disturbed by any more diseases. The combination of knowledge and wisdom brings me to the realization that I am complete, and hence I do not get affected by what happens to the body.   Next, Shri Krishna says that this person is steady like an anvil. A favourable object does not cause excitement in him, and an unfavourable object does not cause any agitation in him. Is it because he has become like a stone? No, it is because he is content with himself. He does not need to rush out into the world of objects to fulfill himself. He knows that desire and hatred are components of sense organs, as we saw in earlier chapters. So when he knows that desire and hatred is not his, and the reactions is not his, then he remains undisturbed.   Shri Krishna then mentions that such a person has full control over mind and senses. This point repeated countless times because it is the most important thing to do for a seeker, but also the most difficult. Even if we hear it several times it does not sink in. So, such a person becomes steady like an anvil because he remains absolutely steady in his own self. He completely controls his senses, they do not move without permission. There is no restlessness in the body.   What is the vision of this person towards object? He sees sameness in gold, clay and stone. Now he is not foolish. He knows that each of these has value in life, but he does not give them undue importance. He has a rational and practical assessment of each object\u2019s value in the grand scheme of things, but does not super-impose his values on them. These objects fail to attract and excite his mind.   So therefore, such a person is \u201cyuktaha\u201d or completely established in meditation. He has nothing further to do when it comes to meditation."

In this shloka, Shri Krishna tackles the meditator\u2019s outlook towards situations. He says that the meditator who has won over his senses and mind, won over his lower nature, his mind remains well established in the eternal essence all the time.

Joy and sorrow and experienced as emotions at the mind level. Praise and insult are experienced either as boosters or blows to the ego. They are experienced at the intellect level. The body, mind and intellect are part of nature or prakriti. They react to situational changes, which also happen in prakriti.   We have been conditioned to respond to some situations favourably and some situations unfavourably. Our normal response to an unfavourable situation is to impose our will upon it, to change it. But in most cases, it never works. It is like the story of the king wanting to put a carpet on top of his entire kingdom\u2019s land, rather than wear a pair of slippers.   Moreover, two people respond to the same situation differently. A child may not take a scolding from his parents as an insult, because his ego is not fully developed yet. But a teenager will, because his ego is especially sensitive towards insults from his parents.   So therefore, one who knows that situations can only impact the body, mind and intellect, but not his self, he remains peaceful in all situations. If something good or bad happens to a person whom we have no connection with, do we feel any joy or sorrow? We do not. That is the kind of understanding a realized meditator has towards his own body, mind and intellect. He does not feel the need to enter the realm of prakriti to change anything. He remains a witness of all these changes."

But for one who has not conquered oneself, it is only his own self that behaves in animosity, like an enemy.   banduhu : is a friend   aatmaa : oneself   aatmanaa : by oneself   tasya : for him   yena : who has   aatmaa : oneself   eva : only   aatmanaa : oneself   jitaha : conquered   anaatmanaha : for one who has not conquered oneself   tu : but   shatrutve : in a spirit of animosity   varteta : behaves   aatmaa : his own self   eva : only   shatruvat : like an enemy   As further elaboration on the previous shloka, Shri Krishna explains exactly what he means by the statement \u201cwe are our own friend and we are our own enemy\u201d. He says that for the person that has used his intellect to conquer the mind and senses, he becomes his own friend. But for one who is unable to conquer the mind and senses, he becomes his own enemy. Note the repeated use of the word \u201caatmaa\u201d or self in this shloka and the prior shloka to mean different things.   Now, what exactly is a \u201cshatru\u201d or enemy? It is someone who constantly creates trouble for us \u2013 a trouble maker. The mind, if not under our control, can be the world\u2019s most creative and impactful trouble maker. We tend to think it is our boss, our mother-in-law, our neighbour and so on to be our enemy, the troublemaker. But nothing beats that mind when it comes to creating problems for us.   Consider an example. Let\u2019s say the doctor has told us that sweets are bad for us. Now, imagine that we are at a social gathering and someone offers us a sweet. The intellect instantly knows what is the right thing to do. But the mind is different from the intellect. If the mind is not under control, it will say \u201cgo ahead, there is no harm in taking one piece of the sweet\u201d.   At this point, we fall prey to the lower self and eat the sweet. The mind now says, \u201cthis is a very tasty sweet. I think I will have this again tomorrow, first thing in the morning\u201d. Again we succumb to the lower self on the next day and eat the sweet again. Now, having eaten the sweet twice, the mind says \u201cwhy did I eat this sweet twice? The doctor had said that it is bad for me. I hope this does not impact my health. I absolutely hate myself\u201d.   Here is someone who caused us trouble three times \u2013 before, during and after eating the sweet. But it was not someone from the outside. It was something within \u2013 our own mind. This is why Shri Krishna calls the uncontrolled mind to be the worst enemy possible in regards to our growth. The sweet is a small example of how the uncontrolled mind creates trouble for us day in and day out. Through conditioning by the sense organs, it repeatedly reinforces our likes and dislikes without regard to what is rational.   So the message is clear: progress towards meditation is not possible unless we use karmayoga to bring our mind under control and eliminate as many desires as possible.   In the shlokas so far, Shri Krishna gave an introduction to the topic of meditation. In the rest of this chapter, he will cover all aspects of meditation including: what is meditation, what is the process, what do we have to do internally and externally, what are the obstacles and how do we remove them, and how does such an individual that is established in meditation live in this world, which is the topic he takes up next.   The world for us comprises three aspects: situations that we encounter, objects that we use, and people that we interact with. In the next three shlokas, Shri Krishna takes up each aspect and paints a picture of the meditator\u2019s attitude towards each of these aspects."

He says that in order to progress in the spiritual path, in fact, any undertaking, we have to lift ourselves by our own efforts. We are our own friend if we do so, and if we don\u2019t, we become our own enemy. In other words, our success and failure is entirely in our hands. No other person can help or hurt us.   In previous chapters we encountered the hierarchy of our personality. At the lowest level exist the body and the sense organs. They have the tendency to go out into the world and seek the objects they desire. The eyes desire pleasant images, the tongue desires pleasant tastes and so on. This is our \u201clower self\u201d. Higher than the body and the senses lies the mind. It is the seat of our thoughts and desires. Higher than the mind is the intellect that can make rational decisions. The eternal essence, our higher self, is at the very highest level.   Now, the sense organs are very powerful. Usually, for most of us, the senses forcefully drag the mind out into the world in order to encounter one sense pleasure after another. This is what Shri Krishna calls \u201cdeprecation\u201d in the shloka. It means the tendency of the mind to go lower. But in the intellect that has cultivated discrimination through study of right knowledge, the mind encounters a struggle. It has to choose between being dragged forcefully into the senses, or uplifting itself towards the intellect, and then ultimately towards the eternal essence.   So Shri Krishna asks us to to forcibly uplift our mind by the intellect. How do we do this? Whenever we have the urge to indulge in a sense pleasure, we give focus to our intellect. The intellect will then guide us in the right direction. We have to do this repeatedly and train the mind to go in the right direction.   However, we have to train our mind in the right manner. If we treat it forcefully it will rebel. The mind has got its own tricks, so we should control it by becoming friends with it. All of our saadhanaas, our efforts, should be done intelligently, slowly and steadily. Only then does the journey become easy.   Furthermore, we also have to ensure that we do not fall any further, even if we are not able to raise the level of our mind. When climbing a mountain, mountaineers hammer nails into the rock and secure themselves with rope. This protects the mountaineers against falling down in case they slip. Similarly, when we look back at this stage a few years from now, we should see spiritual progress, not further degradation in our life.   Now, this is a tough task. Who will help us? Shri Krishna says that you yourself are your friend, you only can help yourself. When we are hungry, it does not help us if someone else eats our food. Similarly, our upliftment is in our own hands. If we can prevent ourselves from falling prey to the lower self, our higher self becomes our best friend. For instance, if we are reading the Gita and the mind gets distracted, we should bring our higher self into the picture. But if our minds continually succumb to the lower self, it becomes our worst enemy.   Therefore, Shri Krishna urges us to gently but firmly bring our mind into control, and orient it towards the intellect and our higher self."

He says that it refers to a person who no longer gets attracted or attached to sense objects and actions. This happens because that person finds contentment within himself and does not need to rush out into the world, in other words, he does not have sankalpas.   So far we have understood sankalpa to mean desire. Now, let us understand the deeper meaning of sankalpa. As we have seen throughout the Gita, ignorance of our true self is the root cause of all our sorrows. Ignorance makes us think that we are incomplete. It causes desires that push the mind to go outward to seek happiness. This outward projection is called sankalpa. Typically, sankalpa is seen in the urge to give undue importance to objects, and to actions.   No matter how much we want to deny it, each one of us has a weakness for certain material objects. We think that those objects will give us happiness, peace, security, stability and so on. But if we follow path of karmayoga diligently, the undue importance we place on objects slowly diminishes.   As an example, compare the experience of a child walking in a toystore to that of an adult doing the same thing. The minute the child enters into the store, each object pulls the child towards itself, as it were. The pull is so strong that the child thinks that he cannot live without these toys. A multitude of desires get generated in his mind. He gets excited and restless. But if an adult walks into the toy store, he may very well appreciate the toys, but there is no urge or force that compels him to get attached to any toy. Once our outlook towards all objects of the world is like that adult in a toy store, we are fit for meditation.   Similarly, we have a fascination towards performance of actions. But when we deeply examine our actions, we realize that most of these are performed due to a herd mentality, in other words, because everyone else is doing it, and because we think we will be left out of a group if we do not perform those actions. Many of us pursue educational and career paths by emulating what someone else had done.   Another reason that we perform actions is for strengthening our ego (asmita). Our ego puffs up when we say \u201cI did this\u201d. We forget that actions are part of nature, that they are happening of their own accord. For instance, we do not boast when we have taken a shower or when one of our hands puts a bandage on another hand. So it is only when we have a similar attitude towards all actions that we perform, that we become fit for meditation.   A child eventually stops putting his finger in the fire, having burned it each time. Similarly our sankalpa, our need to act for gaining objects diminishes as the wisdom gained through contemplation increases. When this wisdom dawns and we diminish our attachment to action and objects, we become yogaroodha or established in dhyaana yoga. In other words, we become qualified for meditation.   This journey to meditation seems arduous. How can we get some support? Who can help us? The next shloka goes into this topic."

Now, he begins to go one level deeper and tell us where we stand, and how should we prepare ourselves for meditation.   Let\u2019s first understand what is meant by a muni or a contemplative person. Most people in this world harbour the notion that worldly objects, people and situations yield happiness. The contemplative person is one who has spent enough time observing the world and understood that notion to be false. He need not have retreated to the forest to contemplate on this. He knows from his daily life experience that the world cannot give joy. Such a muni, who has the desire to go higher, ascend above the material world, is called \u201caarurkshoho\u201d.   So for such a muni, there are two possibilities. One is that he is not established in dhyaana yoga or meditation. His mind still harbours desires. His proportion of sattva guna is lower compared to rajas and tamas. For such a seeker, the only means to get established in meditation is karmayoga. Diligent observance of karmayoga will develop the qualities of discrimination and dispassion (viveka and vairagya), which will ultimately purge desires from the mind.   The second possibility is the muni who has achieved a high level of viveka and vairagya. His mind does not harbour desires due to the predominance of sattva. He only performs the bare minimum of actions that are in line with his obligatory duties. Such a person is \u201caarudha\u201d or elevated. For such a person, meditation will come naturally. All he has to is to follow the instructions given later in this chapter towards \u201cshamaha\u201d, which is quietening the mind.   Consider this illustration. When a child wants to ride a heavy bicycle, he usually cannot climb it directly. He has to put one foot on the pedal and kick the ground with the other foot till the bicycle gathers speed. Only then can he climb the bicycle. So in the initial stage, the child is \u201caarurkshoho\u201d and has to kick the ground until the bike gathers speed. Then when he ascends the bicycle, he becomes \u201caarudha\u201d.   Now, when exactly does the seeker become ready to meditate? This is tackled in the next shloka."

He says that the karmayogi and sannyaasi are, at their core, one and the same. One need not renounce the world in order to become a dhyaana yogi or a meditator. All one needs to do is to follow the path of karmayoga diligently. Only when the tendency to create new desires or sankalpa goes away can one become a meditator.   How can the action-oriented karmayogi and the actionless-oriented monk be the same? Let us investigate. It is only when the mind of the seeker is free of sankalpa does he become ready for meditation. Meditation can occur only when the mind is tranquil. Tranquility only occurs when the mind is rid of all desires. Now the question arises that how do we know whether such tranquility exists? Have we experienced it? Yes we have. Once we finally get an object that we were craving for a long time, our mind experiences tranquility for a fraction of a second. This is caused due to a temporary cessation of desires, and ends when new desires start agitating the mind again.   If one has reached an advanced stage in the spiritual journey where desires have gone down to a minimum, one becomes actionless automatically. We saw this in the fifth chapter. But if one still harbours desires, karmayoga is the means to slowly diminish desires through renouncing the results of action. So what needs to be renounced is attachment to results of action, not action itself. This recurring message drives home the point that action-orientation and actionless-orientation are the same, as long as the attachment to results is renounced. They both have the same effect: tranquility of mind."

He says that one who performs actions in the spirit of karmayoga, per his definition, is both a monk and a meditator. The meditator is not one who has given up his duties or actions, who has run away from the world.   Meditation is a topic that fascinates everyone. We like the idea of going to a retreat, away from all our troubles, and sit in a tranquil place to meditate. But as we shall see in the rest of this chapter, Shri Krishna has a unique viewpoint about the process of meditation, and of who is qualified to become a meditator. He first says that only one who is engaged in the expression of his desires through karmayoga, through the performance of svadharma, is a good meditator.   As long as our vaasanaas or our impressions exist, they will continue to generate desires that will propel us away from the inner self and out into the world. They will make us restless and agitated. So the karmayogi intelligently channels these desires and expresses these desires. The key point is that the results of actions generated by these desires are submitted to a higher ideal, so that the results lose their power to create further selfish desires. As our attachment to results drops, the mental restlessness and agitations diminish, making us fit to pursue meditation.   Shri Krishna drives home the point with two examples. First, he says that one does not have to renounce fire in order to perform meditation. In the olden days, householders would maintain a sacrificial fire in their homes. Absence of the fire indicated renouncing the duties of a householder. In other words, Shri Krishna says that one does not have to give up their household duties for pursuing meditation. Second, one does not have to physically renounce action and retire to a monastery to meditate. The culmination of karmayoga is the loss of sense of doership. This is the qualification of a meditator."

        "content": "The fifth chapter titled \u201cKarma Sanyaasa Yoga\u201d began with Arjuna\u2019s question to Shri Krishna. The question was : what was better, renouncing all actions and becoming a monk, or performing actions as a karma yogi? Shri Krishna addressed this question by reiterating a nuance that Arjuna had missed.        Renouncing of actions did not mean giving up the physical performance of actions, it meant renouncing the sense of doership, the sense that \u201cI am doing something\u201d. In order to get to this stage, one has to have purified one\u2019s mind completely of desires. In that regards, performing actions in the spirit of karmayoga was the correct course of action for Arjuna, since he still harboured desires. As one continues to dedicate the result of actions to Ishvara, one\u2019s sense of enjoyership and doership automatically diminishes.        Next, Shri Krishna expounded upon the vision of realized seeker. He provided a detailed illustration of body, mind and intellect functioning on their own,  including the acts of perception, cognition and intellect\u2019s response to stimuli. All these acts in reality happen without  the involvement of \u201cI\u201d. The illustration that the \u201cI\u201d resides in a city of nine gates was given to further drive home the point.        Another aspect of the realized seeker\u2019s vision is his \u201csama drishti\u201d or the sameness of vision. The realized seeker sees the same eternal essence in a human, elephant, dog, dog eater. Not only that, he also sees the same eternal essence in positive and negative experiences. He holds the convictions that these \u201cdefects\u201d or modifications are part of prakriti. He does not view these defects as part of the eternal essence since the eternal essence is ever perfect.        Then Shri Krishna explained that just like the eternal essence in the body does not cause action, so too does the eternal essence at the cosmic level not cause action. Neither does the eternal essence connect results to actions, nor does it dole out sin and merit. All these transaction happen inside prakriti or nature. The example of the Pac Man video game was given in order to illustrate that prakriti is an automated system that works just like a video game. It rewards and punishes actions based on well-defined rules, without the need for external intervention.        In the closing shlokas of the fifth chapter, Shri Krishna slowly begins pointing us toward meditation. Meditation is the only way for the seeker to get fully established in the eternal essence. The primary goal has to be the realization of eternal essence and nothing else, this thirst is needed. Next, Shri Krishna informs us that it is the sense contacts that are obstacles to meditation. Our mind rushes our due to the urges generated desire and anger. Only by controlling this urge can we progress towards meditation.         Lastly, Shri Krishna elaborates on the state of a liberated seeker. Such a seeker has discovered the infinite joy within himself. He finds no need to rush outside into the world for joy and bliss."

In this shloka, he gives us the objective of meditation. In other words, this shloka tells us what one comes to know in the state of meditation. This shloka is a preview of the topic covered in the seventh chapter to the twelfth chapter, which is the elaboration of Ishvara.   The goal of meditation is to realize the eternal essence. It is akin to a wave that realizes its identity with water. In this manner, the wave realizes that it is no longer the finite entity that it once was. It is one wave but also it is many waves. It is the entire ocean. Similarly, once the meditator realizes oneness with brahman or the eternal essence (water) , he attains Ishvara (ocean).   Who exactly is Ishvara is covered in the chapters seven through twelve. Only few of his attributes are covered here. First, he is the cosmic enjoyer or the cosmic recipient. Any work that is performed for the welfare of society is automatically dedicated to Ishvara. This was the theme of the third chapter on karmayoga where we are advised to act in a selfless manner, and dedicate the results of our actions to a higher ideal. Ishvara is the highest ideal possible because he encompasses the entire cosmos.   Next, Ishvara is called the controller of all beings. Through prakriti or maaya, Ishvara manifests as the laws or rules by which our lives as well as the lives of plants, animals and inert objects are governed. We saw earlier that the universe functions through inherent laws such as gravity and electromagnetism. In that regard, Ishvara through these laws controls us.   Finally, Ishvara\u2019s laws are fair. They treat everyone equally. They work without any expectation or ulterior motive. They also work non-stop, just like our heart beats and our breath functions all the time. In this manner, Ishvara is the highest well-wisher and friend of all beings. If we too make friends with Ishvara, which is another way of saying that we work in the best interest of the world, we do not have to worry about our well-being. Ishvara takes care of us.   So therefore, one who comes to know the eternal essence, and realizes his unity with Ishvara during meditation, attains peace. This is the concluding message of the fifth chapter of the Gita.   om tatsatiti shrimadbhagavadgitasu upanishadsu brahmavidyayaam yogashastre shrikrishnaarjunasamvade   karmasanyaasayogonaamo panchamodhyaahaha || 5 ||"

The \u201cthat person\u201d refers to the person from the previous shloka who has prepared himself physically for meditation. Now, the internal preparation is pointed out.   First, Shri Krishna says that while sitting for meditation, there should be no other objective but that of liberation. If the objective is not pure, if one wants to harm someone by meditation, then the practice will be distracted and the goal will not be reached. In the Puraanic literature, there are many examples of demons that practiced meditation for powers that would help them destroy others. Such goals are not to be harboured. The only goal should be liberation.   Also important is the role that we identify with when we sit for meditation. If sit down as father, we will always think of children. If sit down as an employee, we will think of job-related problems all the time. These roles do not go away easily due to our strong identification with one or many roles. There should be no role while meditation, only the goal of liberation.   So therefore, one who through karmayoga and purified his mind of fear, anger and desire, who has restrained his sense organs, and whose ultimate goal is liberation and not some worldly goal, that person is ready for meditation. But what is the object of meditation? The last shloka of this chapter addresses this point."

He explains the technique of meditation in a nutshell, but goes into the details in the next chapter. In a nutshell, the technique involves clearing the mind of all external sense object impressions, keeping eyes focused on one point, and equalizing the incoming and outgoing breath.   The eternal essence cannot be realized if the mind is dwelling on sense objects, therefore the technique requires us to temporarily cut off connection with sense objects. Practically, we cannot shut off the world completely i.e. if we hear a sound somewhere, it will enter into our ears. The point is that we should not let our mind chase any sense perception. Further, even if the mind is not receiving sensory inputs, it should be restrained from going into the past or the future.   Next, Shri Krishna asks us to focus the eyes in the middle of the eyebrows. This is because the eyes follow the mind and its thoughts. If the mind is restless, the eyes will wander. So keeping the eyes steady has the effect of stabilizing the mind. In the same way, if the mind is restless, it is reflected in the breath. So we are asked to balance the incoming and outgoing breath with the aim of calming the mind. If the breathing becomes harmonious, we know that the mind has become calm.   So in this manner, Shri Krishna describes how we should physically prepare ourself for meditation. In the next shloka, he points out the internal preparation. We notice that this shloka ends in mid-sentence. The rest of the sentence is found in the next shloka."

In this shloka, he provides the last set of attributes of the person who has attained liberation by establishing himself in the eternal essence. He says that such a person is free from desire and aversion due to his control of his mind and intellect.   Like we saw in the previous shloka, ignorance of the true nature of oneself is the critical defect of the mind. It is this ignorance alone that creates desire and aversion. We do not find pleasure within ourselves, so we rush outside with desire. If the desire is not obtained, we get irritated and angry. This is the life of an ignorant person in a nutshell. It is the constant seeking of pleasure, and getting annoyed when pleasure is not obtained. So the wise person, having removed his ignorance, is free from desire and anger.   So then, to conclude the chapter\u2019s teachings, Shri Krishna says that such a wise person \u2013 one who has identified with the eternal essence \u2013 obtains liberation from all sides. In other words, such a wise person is liberated while he is living, and remains liberated after he dies.   The Gita prescribes a step-by-step approach to liberation,         which is elaborated in various chapters throughout the text. It begins with karma yoga, where a seeker follows his svadharma to purify his mind and prepare it for instruction. Next, he receives instruction and knowledge on the eternal essence through shravana (hearing), manana (clearing doubts through self-inquiry) and nidhidhyaasana (internalization). The last step of internalization is accomplished through dhyaana yoga or meditation, which is the topic of the next chapter.   But before we begin the next chapter, Shri Krishna provides a preview of dhyaana yoga in the next and last three shlokas of this chapter."

Such a liberated seeker is called a \u201crishi\u201d. It means one who knows, one who has knowledge of the eternal essence. Typically, we think of a rishi as someone who has a beard and wears a robe. It is not so. A rishi uses knowledge and discrimination constantly and knows the difference between the real and the unreal. Such a rishi has four attributes per this shloka: free of all defects, free from all doubts, complete self control, and engaged in the welfare of all beings.   The rishi is \u201cksheena-kalmasha\u201d, which means that he has freed himself of all mental impurities. The core or the key mental impurity is ignorance which manifests in the form of affinity for worldly pleasures. It is ignorance alone from which all impurities are others based off. It is through karmayoga that we rid ourselves of all mental impurities.   Next, the rishi is \u201cchhinna-dvaidah\u201d. He is free from all doubts regarding who is really is. Until the mind has doubts, the notion that \u201cI am the eternal essence\u201d will come and go, but it will not be permanent. There will be no conviction behind it. Desires that push us out into the world are the obstruction to such a permanent conviction. \u201cChhinna \u2013 dvaidah\u201d also means free of all notions of duality.   \u201cYataatmaanah\u201d is another word used to describe the rishi. He has complete self control, in other words, he has compete control over his mind and senses. He is not like most of us who are under the mind\u2019s control. The rishi know that the body, mind and senses are different than his true self which is the eternal essence. Once he realizes that they are different than him and have no relation to him, he does not come under their control.   Furthermore, the rishi is \u201csarva bhuta hite rathaah\u201d, which means that he is always engaged in the welfare of all. Now this does not mean necessarily that he is engaged in social service. It means that the rishi is always in a state of total non-violence. He sees no distinction between himself, one person and another person.It is like water and the fish. Regardless of what the fish does, the water lives in total harmony with the fish. One has no fear for the other.   So therefore, such a rishi is the one who is fit to attain liberation, where he dissolves himself into the eternal essence, just like a wave dissolves into the ocean."

The word yogi here refers to a realized seeker. The entire personality of such a seeker is completely turned inward toward the eternal essence. This state is described by three words: antahasukhaha, antaraaraamaha and antarjyotihi.   The person who finds bliss within is called antahasukhaha. He does not expect anything from the outside world. The idea that something other than himself will make him happy, that idea has completely gone. To recap a point from the earlier shloka, he experience bliss by seeking positivity within him, it is not negating what is outside. It is like the sun reflected in water. The reflection will never match the brightness of the sun itself. Similarly the joy obtained through the senses is \u201creflected happiness\u201d. But a yogi who has shifted attention to his inner self gets the real deal.   Typically, our mind needs to constantly come into contact with an object, person or situation. This         causes agitation in our minds. However, objects, people and situations keep changing. The economy changes, our friends change, our health changes and so on. But the realized seeker is antararaamaha. He revels in himself. Another way to look at this word is \u201cantara-aarama\u201d, which means that he rests in himself. He has eliminated all agitations and is completely at ease with himself. There is nothing that compels him to do anything, he just \u201cis\u201d.   Furthermore, the realized seeker stops looking towards more and more sources of knowledge. He is antarjyotihi. He knows that the eternal essence alone is the ultimate knowledge, the ultimate source of light. In most traditional temples, the only source of light is inside the central room where the deity is located. Symbolically, it depicts the internal light of the self.   In this manner, one who is happy in his own self, revels in his own self and finds knowledge in one\u2019s own self, such a person is a true enlightened seeker. By such deep identification with the eternal essence, he becomes the eternal essence. In other words, he attains the ultimate liberation or \u201cnirvaana\u201d. Liberation is the destruction of all limitations and all notions of finitude. It is the realization that what is in oneself is the same as what is in everything else."

He says that in a person who working towards purifying his mind, there still exists two major obstacles to realization: desire and anger. Both of these generate impulses that cause the mind to go out into the material world. Even though the seeker cannot get rid of desire and anger, but can check the impulses caused by them, that person will attain happiness from within than from without.   Let\u2019s examine what exactly is desire and anger in the framework of the Gita. Whenever one encounters sense pleasures, or recalls a memory of a sense pleasure, the need to re-experience that sense pleasure is called desire. Conversely, whenever one encounters a sorrowful circumstance, or recalls a sorrowful memory, the repulsion generated is called anger. Both these emotions generate impulses to chase after, or run away from an object, person or circumstance. For the mind to realize the eternal essence, it needs to be even-keel. But these impulses take the mind outwards and destabilize it.   Now, there is a possibility of a Catch-22 situation here. There will be an impulse within us to seek joy. Unless we redirect it inward, it will always rush outward. But if we redirect it inward and it does not find joy, it will again go outward. Therefore, turning this impulse inward has to be done intelligently. If all we do is cut ourselves off from the objects that give us pleasure, it will not work. Instead, we must work diligently towards purification of our mind and performance of svaadhyaava, whether it is reading of scriptures, or pooja and so on. As our mind finds exponentially more joy in svaadhyaaya, it will automatically turn inwards and drop its fascination with external objects.   The next two shlokas describe the state of the person who finds inner bliss."

Here, Shri Krishna provides another compelling reason to turn away from sense pleasures. He says, in no uncertain terms, that pleasures born out of sense contact are not really pleasures at all. They are not just sorrow disguised as pleasure, they are \u201cwombs\u201d of sorrow. Which means, a single experience of sense contact sows the seed for multiple sorrows.   For many of us, the period of transition between academic life and work life is when a lot of these seeds are sown. As we start earning money, we automatically seem to find outlets to spend this money. Some develop an attachment to high-end coffee. Some develop an attachment to going to clubs. Some develop a taste for vehicles and so on. If we introspect, we realize that the pleasure obtained by any of these objects is not just fleeting, but results in a chain of sorrow later. Take high-end coffee for instance. The first few times it is quite pleasurable. But later, you cannot do without it.   But then, where does the pleasure arise in the first place? The mind is restless without constant sense contact. Depending upon the strength of the vaasanaas that we have cultivated, it experiences a vacuum and rushes out into the material world towards an object in order to fill that vacuum. At the same time, the eternal essence present within us, having identified with the mind, also rushes out into the world. When the sense contact happens, the mind temporarily ceases to move outside and comes into contact with the eternal essence. This results in joy.   So, here is where the mix-up happens. The joy was already inside us, the mind causes us to believe that it is outside us. Furthermore, this joy is short-lived because the mind will again go out into the material world. Then the cycle of sorrow (vacuum) and joy (sense contact) will repeat itself. This is called \u201csamsaara\u201d.   Therefore, Shri Krishna urges us to become wise people and realize that sense contact is not the true source of joy. Next, Shri Krishna goes into the root cause of the mind rushing out into the world."

From this shloka onwards, he starts turning us towards the topic of meditation. Turning oneself inwards, away from the sense objects of the world, is the first step towards meditation. To this end, he explains the reason for turning inward.   Our entire life is geared towards the pursuit of happiness. However, if we introspect, we realize that the happiness we get from sense objects such as tasty food or a visually appealing movie is instantaneous, but fleeting. Sense objects are finite, and so it the happiness that they can provide. Moreover, if we are not careful, we get attached to whatever gives us instant happiness so that we can repeat that experience. This also leads to sorrow, which comes from constant commentary and judgement from intellect when we lose access to sense objects.   But Shri Krishna gives us a better alternative. When we slowly move away from sense objects and turn inward to contemplate on the eternal essence, we can tap into a source of happiness that is much greater than any happiness produced by sense objects. Moreover, this happiness is never-ending, it is inexhaustible, because it is derived out of the eternal essence which is infinite."

Like any other person, the realized seeker encounters pleasant and unpleasant situations. He cannot avoid them. But the difference is that these situations do not destabilize the realized seeker. In other words, they do not cause elation or depression.   Usually, when something undesirable happens to someone that we do not know, it does not affect us. But if it happens to us \u2013 say we fall sick \u2013 it affects us deeply. But the wise person has transcended the ego. He recognizes that every situation is part of nature. In nature, elements are interacting with the elements in multiple configurations. Once he has this vision, happenings of the world do not impact the realized seeker.   It is important to note that situations, both good and bad, have their place in our lives. Unpleasant experiences are useful from relative world perspective because they usually have a lesson embedded within them. With each unpleasant situation the emotion of sadness will arise. But in a realized seeker there will be a space between the emotion and the self. For example, if we are on a boat, the ups and downs of the sea will impact us. But if we are standing on a rock on the shore, the ups and downs of sea do not affect us.   Why do realized seekers remain unperturbed? Their understanding of the eternal essence has become stable and firm. They have become \u201csthitha prajnya\u201d. They are free from the delusion of doership and enjoyership. Initially, when this knowledge is first gained, it stays on the surface. We experience the eternal essence sporadically, for a brief instance, then immediately go back into identification with the body/mind/intellect.   So therefore, the one who constantly maintains the identification of the eternal essence becomes one with the eternal essence. He remains a pure witness of the ups and downs of the material world.   Footnotes   1. Tulsidas has said that the ocean remains same in rain or drought, but a small lake overflows and dries up. It is a simple yet powerful example of the different between a realized seeker\u2019s vision and an ordinary person\u2019s vision."

Here, he goer deeper into this point and addresses some questions that could come up when trying to understand that shloka.   Consider a hardened criminal. Most of us would classify his behaviour as defective. Now, given the context of the previous shloka where the wise person perceives a criminal and a saint with the same vision. How does it actually happen? To address this point, Shri Krishna mentions in this shloka that the personality of the criminal has the defect, not the eternal essence. The eternal essence is inherently defect-free.   Another question that may arise is this. When and where does one attain the eternal essence? How much time will it take and how far away is it? The answer is that notions such as near/far, and slow/fast are dualities. Any such duality belongs to nature, not the the eternal essence. Therefore, one whose intellect has transcended duality immediately attains the eternal essence. Notions such as near/far, and slow/fast cease to have meaning.   Finally, Shri Krishna explains that attaining the eternal essence is possible here and now. We do not have to wait for another birth. Following the technique of karma yoga, we have to purify our mind and make it steady and harmonious, so that it can meditate on the eternal essence."

Unlike most of us how tend to focus on the differences, the realized seeker focuses on the eternal essence which is common in every plant, animal, human, situation and inanimate object. In chapter two, we saw the example of the child who want a cookie shaped like a lion, whereas the adult does not really care because his focus is in the dough that is common within each cookie.   A spectrum of entities has been laid out before us, from the braahman that has a high level of sattva, to a cow that has lesser sattvic content, all the way to an individual with a miniscule, almost non-existent level of sattva. Shri Krishna says that the wise person sees the eternal essence in all of them.   This ability to see the oneness is all is praised throughout our scriptures. In the Raamaayana, Tulsidaas says the one should view both friends and enemies equally. Why? Because when enemies leave, they give sorrow. But when friends leave, they too give sorrow. It is just a matter of perspective.   Now, just because the wise person views everyone with a similar vision does not mean he treats them similarly, or deals with them similarly. He will deal with a dog differently than how he would treat a braahman. How is it possible? It is just like we see our body as one, but we treat our eye differently then we would treat the soles of our feet.

There is nothing in your life but music\u201d. That statement reveals how much thirst a person has for his goal.   In this shloka, Shri Krishna illustrates the personality of the seeker whose aspiration for the eternal essence is so intense that his entire personality resonates with that thirst for the eternal essence. His mind, intellect, conviction, goal \u2013 all these are aligned with the eternal essence.   It is important that both the mind and intellect need to be convinced that the only goal worth pursuing is the eternal essence, even if the eternal essence has not yet been realized. It is like the scientists who planned the mission to the moon, yet none of them had ever been on the moon. The mind needs to have love for the moon, and the intellect needs to enjoy the intellectual challenge that the task entails. If only the mind is convinced, it could lead into superstition. If only the intellect is convinced, it could lead into nihilism. Only when mind and intellect are convinced is when the whole personality is oriented towards the eternal essence.

The light of the sun does not create anything new. It just shows us what was already there, but was hidden by darkness. Similarly, the knowledge of the eternal essence does not create anything new in us. It just reveals our true nature.   Why does Shri Krishna emphasize knowledge so much? The central theme of the Gita is the removal of delusion. The root cause of delusion is ignorance, which is nothing but our identification to the body, mind and intellect. All our efforts should be towards uprooting this ignorance through the correct knowledge. However, our lives are spent in trying to solve problems at the worldly level.   There is always one aspect of our lives that is incomplete or imperfect. For some of us, it could be our job. For others, it could be our family and friends. For some others, it could be our health. Given these various imperfections, we try to better our situation by changing our job, friends and so on. This results in a roller coaster ride of joys and sorrows.   But if we take a truly objective look at this situation, it turns out that we are looking for perfection in the material world, which will always be imperfect.

In this shloka, he takes us another step further in explaining the distinctness of eternal essence from action. He says that even sin and merit also have nothing to do with eternal essence. He also further says that action, result, doership, enjoyership, sin, merit \u2013 the notion that these belong to the \u201cI\u201d, the eternal essence, is termed as ignorance. This ignorance is caused due to our strong identification with the body, mind and intellect.   Let us refer to the Pac-Man example from the previous post. Based on his actions in the video game, the Pac-Man character can gain points (merits) or lose points (demerits). This gaining and losing of points is again based on rules of the video game. It, too, is a fully automatic system that does not require any external intervention to work.   Now, in some places in the Gita, Shri Krisha asks us to offer merit and sin to God. But here it is said that eternal essence does not take sin or merit. So how do we reconcile this seeming contradiction? The key thing to understand here is that the person who thinks he is associated with action, sin and merit is at one level, and the person who has identified himself with eternal essence is at another level. It is just like saying that the points accumulated in a Pac-Man game have no bearing in the real world. The game and the real world are two different realms.   Another way to look at it is as follows. Sin and merit are duality. They are two sides of the same coin, as it were, just like black/white, heat/cold and day/night. When you rise above it, duality has no bearing. Day and night do not mean anything when one is in outer space, when one leaves the earth and rises above it.   Here\u2019s another noteworthy point. Shri Krishna has used an interesting word to refer to ignorant people in this shloka. He calls them creatures. It is a subtle hint that as long as we operate with body identification, we are similar to animals who also operate only at that level."

In this shloka, he takes us one step further by saying that the eternal essence is beyond the realm of action. Furthermore, since action implies doership, results and their enjoyership, action and everything that comes with it is in the realm of prakriti or nature. The eternal essence is separate and distinct from action.   Any self-contained system has inherent rules which govern its operations. For example, let us consider the Pac-Man video game. The game is played in a computer that has four buttons which are used to move Pac-Man up, down, left or right. The rules of the game are programmed into the system. If the player manages to get the fruit while evading the monsters, he wins the game. All this happens automatically. It does not require external intervention by any divine or human entity.   But if we take a step back, the Pac-Man character does not really \u201cmove\u201d anywhere. It is an illusion created by the computer by projecting the Pac-Man image to different parts of the screen. One who is watching the game very objectively knows that there is no movement of left, right etc.   Similarly, one who sees the world from the absolute standpoint of the eternal essence knows that in reality, there is no action. Action only exists from the standpoint of nature or prakriti. And if action only exists in nature, so does doership, enjoyership, and connection of actions to their results. It is a self-governing automatic system."

The picture he paints here is that one who identifies himself with the eternal essence, knows that he is only a dweller in the body, just like the resident of a city knows that he is a dweller, who is totally distinct from the city.   Imagine that you move into a new city for a job. As part of the move, you begin to utilize the city\u2019s services such as water, electricity, garbage collection, telephone, cable etc. But while you utilize these services, you know that you are a resident of the city. You don\u2019t begin to think that you are directly responsible for running the city. For example, when you someone picks up the garbage, it is part of the city\u2019s services. You are in no way \u201crunning\u201d the services.   Similarly, the enlightened seeker knows that he is the eternal essence, which is a dweller in the body and separate from the body. The body is pictorially depicted as a city with nine gates, each gate being an orifice (ear, nostril, eye) and so on. So when the seeker uses his hands, for example, he knows that the body, mind and intellect are operating independently. The enlightened seeker is in actuality, doing nothing at all. Just like the resident knows that the city\u2019s services operate by themselves, and he is just a witness, similarly the enlightened person knows that the self is just a resident in the body, totally separate from the body.   Another indication of the seeker\u2019s state is that he has complete control of his senses, and that he has mentally renounced the notion of doership. He knows that it is the body, mind and intellect that is performing action. This is indicated in the first part of the shloka. The end result is that the seeker, knowing that he is separate and distinct from the actions of the body, mind and intellect, lives in complete bliss.   Footnotes   1. Adi Shankaraachaarya in his commentary of this shloka gives an indicator that differentiates an enlightened seeker from an ordinary seeker. Let\u2019s say we ask someone the question: \u201cwhere are you sitting?\u201d. If the person answers \u201con a chair\u201d etc, then he is an ignorant seeker. If he answers \u201cI am always sitting in the body\u201d, he is an enlightened seeker."

While both perform the very same action, and could very well get the same result, their attitude towards the work is different. One who follows karma yoga maintains the attitude that \u201cI am not attached to the results\u201d, whereas the materialistic person does not maintain this attitude.   The ignorant person does action for sake of the result. He does not find joy in work itself. If the result is favourable, he gets extremely elated. But this happiness, and in some instances, peace of mind, is temporary. The minute a result of actions becomes favourable, he gets extremely dejected and disappointed. But the karma yogi does not wait for the result of the action to give joy. He finds joy in the work. The peace that he attains is driven from within, rather than from without.   It is this mental attitude that differentiates the karma yogi from the materialistic person. The easiest way to gauge our progress towards karma yoga is to constantly monitor our state of mind. If we get agitated for long periods of time when we receive the result of our action, it is an indication that we have generated an attachment to the result, which in turn indicates that the ego is strong.   The words used to describe both types of seekers bear closer scrutiny. \u201cYuktaha\u201d literally means yoked or established. In this context, yuktaha means one whose mind is yoked to the intellect. In other words, the mind is under the guidance of the intellect. In contrast, \u201cayuktaha\u201d is one whose mind is not yoked to the intellect. It follows the direction of the mind and the senses. This difference in the orientation of the mind determines the fate of the seeker."

But how exactly does he do that? Shri Krishna in this shloka says that the karma yogi continuously keeps the thought that the body, mind, intellect and senses \u2013 all these are the property of Ishvara, given by Ishvara. Therefore, all the work done is for the benefit for Ishvara, and not for the ego.   The Gita teaches that the body, mind, intellect and senses are not really \u201cours\u201d. But due to our conditioning, we come to think that they are ours. We then begin to do things for their benefit. For example, the tongue likes sweet food, so we undertake actions to satisfy it by eating things that may not be healthy from a long term perspective. When actions are done for the satisfaction of body, mind, intellect and senses, the sense of \u201cmine-ness\u201d develops and the ego gets strengthened. We then begin to serve the ego.   In this regard, let us recall example of the CFO we had encountered a while ago. As long as the CFO thinks that she is working for company, things will go smoothly. But if she begins to think that working for herself, starts misusing the company\u2019s funds as her own funds, she gets into trouble. Similarly, a karma yogi treats his body, mind, intellect and senses as instruments of Ishvara. When that attitude comes, all actions and their results also get offered to Ishvara. In this manner, the seeker detaches himself from the body, mind, intellect and senses from the ego,         and attaches them to Ishvara. This is what is meant by \u201ccasting off all attachment\u201d.   Now, let\u2019s examine the second part of shloka where Shri Krishna talks about purification of self. What happens when karma yogi continues to dedicate actions to Ishvara? His mind gets cleared of all selfish desire, and his ego begins to lose its power. The end result is that the mind is purified of all vaasanaas \u2013 which is what is meant by \u201cself\u201d in the shloka. Purification of mind brings the karmayogi closer to self-realization."

He knows that he is not the doer of all his actions. But what about the one who has not realized the self, and who is still working to sublimate his selfish desires? What is his vision?   In this shloka, Shri Krishna says that the person who has not realized the self (that includes most of us) offers all actions in a spirit of devotion to Ishvara. Shri Krishna reiterates that if one has selfish desires, karma yoga is the ideal path to follow. The karma yogi works for a higher ideal such as Ishvara, but one who does not follow karma yoga works for the ego.   Shri Krishna brings Arjuna back to karma yoga with this shloka. Arjuna harbours desires, therefore Shri Krishna does not want him to jump straight into the yoga of renunciation, which is a totally different level.   Now, let\u2019s go a little deeper into the topic of attachment. Attachment can happen at four levels : attachment to the result of an action (I want a reward for singing this song), attachment to the action (I will sing a song only in my way), attachment to the sense of doership (I am singing this song) and attachment to the sense of non-doership (By not singing the song, I am the non-singer of this song). The first three are relatively easier to comprehend. The fourth one arises when one has not properly understood the notion of akarma or inaction from the fourth chapter.   So therefore, the karma yogi strives to transcend all four levels of attachment by offering results, actions, doership and non-doership to Ishvara. When he acts in the material world with such a vision, he does not accumulate any further desires, just like a lotus leaf does not get wet even though growing in water."

So to make this as explicit as possible, Shri Krishna provided a detailed illustration of that teaching in this shloka. Here, he gives a comprehensive list of all activities performed by the body, mind and intellect. By providing this illustration, Shri Krishna demonstrates that one who has realized the eternal essence knows, in fact asserts, that he is not doing anything, and all these activities are happening automatically through the body, mind and intellect.   Having looked at this list of activities, we say         \u2013 yes we understand that blinking, hearing, dreaming and so on is automatic. But what about the process of thinking? Shri Krishna says that even the process of thought also happens automatically. Till such time as the ego is sublimated, it drives our mind to generate selfish thoughts. As the ego gets sublimated through karma yoga, selfish thoughts slowly transition to selfless ones. But the self , or the \u201cI\u201d, is just the witness of all these actions for one who has realized the eternal essence. Till then, the \u201cI\u201d thinks that it is the doer.   Only one who has realized the vision of the eternal essence truly knows that he is not the doer. What then, should be the vision of the karmayogi who wants to ultimately have this vision? This topic is tackled in the next shloka."

Even while acting, that person does not generate any further desires, because he has the same vision that a renouncer has. He sees the eternal essence everywhere, in himself as well as in everyone else. And like the example we saw earlier, his vision indicates that his entire personality, including his mind and intellect, have gained the knowledge of the eternal essence.   Furthermore, Shri Krishna reminds us that such knowledge is not possible without first bringing the body, mind and senses under control. Actions performed by such an individual do not \u201ctaint\u201d him. Only when the sense of doership and enjoyership is present can actions can taint someone, in other words, cause further desires to sprout.

The best option is to start with karmayoga, because like the yoga of knowledge, it too will yield the same result of self-realization.   To understand this, let us examine a different question: Why are there so few PhDs in the world? It takes a certain kind of person to obtain a PhD. One has to be ready to spend most of their life in a lab. One has to do what it takes to get their experiment right. They have to survive on their petty stipend for several years. And all this is for the sole objective of discovering something that benefits mankind.   Similarly, not many people can minimize their worldly activities so much that they retire to an ashram to gain knowledge from a teacher. For most of us, the pull of our desires is so strong that we will continue to work in this world. Therefore, liberation has to come from our actions, not through renunciation.   Furthermore, Shri Krishna also mentions a caveat about action. One should not perform actions just like that. Karmayoga advocates thoughtful action, where one thinks before one acts. The biggest obstacle in moving forward spiritually is our ego. It creates selfish desires that move us towards the material world. So when we performs actions thoughtfully, in other words, when we ensure that our actions are performed without attachment towards the result, our selfish desires automatically get slowly eliminated."

In the context of this chapter, they mean yoga of action (karmayoga) and yoga of knowledge through renunciation (karma sannyaasa yoga) respectively. Having added this context, the shloka now reads as follows: one who obtains the state of bliss through the yoga of knowledge, also reaches that same state through the yoga of action. In the wise person\u2019s view, both of these are one. It is like two passengers boarding a train from different stations. Both reach the same destination.   Let us dig deeper to understand what is common between renunciation and action. Imagine that two people are striving for self-realization. One person performs karma yoga, but does not think carefully about how he performs his actions. Without proper thought and discrimination, his actions become selfish and his vaasanaas increase. Ultimately, he does not attain his goal.   The other person decides that he prefers renunciation. He goes to an ashram to lead the life of a monk. But even thought he has renounced the material world, he keeps thinking about his life in the material world. He too, does not attain his goal, because his desires prevent him from properly absorbing his teacher\u2019s teachings.   In both cases, renunciation and action do not work because they are missing the key ingredient \u2013 knowledge. Unless one uses discrimination while performing action, or maintains the knowledge that I am not the doer prior to renunciation, the goal is not attained by either person. Therefore, Shri Krishna urges wise people to keep discrimination in the picture while considering either stage of the path.   Having reassured Arjuna that both stages yield the same outcome, Shri Krishna next addresses why karma yoga is more appropriate for Arjuna."

He says that the path to attain self-realization is one, but it has two stages. In the first stage, the seeker performs actions per his svadharma, but focuses on checking and sublimating the ego while performing his actions. This stage is called karma yoga. When the seeker has exhausted the majority of his desires, he becomes ready for the next stage.   In the second stage, the seeker minimizes actions other than those performed for gaining knowledge through the guidance of a teacher. The second stage is possible only after the ego has been sublimated through renunciation. This stage is called karma sannyaasa.   Shri Krishna then goes on to say that only people who are ignorant of the connection between these two stages say that karma-sannyaasa and karmayoga are different paths. They also think that it is possible to bypass stage one and go straight to stage two. This ability to bypass stage one is only possible for a handful of advanced seekers in this world, seekers who have already sublimated their desires.   Therefore, having known this, he urges us to become wise people and to not think of the path to self-realization as two different paths. If we become established in one stage, we will automatically get the result of self-realization that one gets from pursuing the other stage. In other words, we should follow the one path that we are qualified for, and follow it properly.   How should a wise person look at these two stages? We will see in the next shloka."

Shri Krishna needed to change that ideal completely. So he defines what it means to be a renouncer or sannyaasi in this shloka. A renouncer is one who completely gives up his ego, not external objects and situations.   In that regard, Shri Krishna says that if we have three qualities: freedom from hatred, expectation and duality, that person is a true renouncer. Firstly, if something is obstacle to happiness, or someone is giving us sorrow, we generate hatred for that person or object. Secondly, if we always keep thinking that we will become happy in the future, we generate expectations, taking consciousness away from the present and into the future. Finally, if we only get attracted to certain aspects of our existence, the other aspects will torture us and bind us. This is what is meant by duality.   So therefore, one who has become free from these 3 qualities has truly renounced the material world, even if he continues to perform his duties. This is a high standard indeed. Having clarified the definition of snanyaasi, Shri Krishna compares a sannyaasi to a karmayogi in the next shloka."

By making this statement, Shri Krishna reiterates the teaching imparted to Arjuna in the beginning of the third chapter, when Arjuna had asked a similar question. Shri Krishna throughout the Gita has stressed that we can attain self-realization while staying in the world and performing our duties. Like Arjuna, we often get tempted to renounce the world, especially when we are going through a tough time in our life. But as we have seen earlier, if we retreat from the world but have not fully addressed our ego and our selfish desires, we will still be thinking about the material world in the confines of the cave or the ashram we have retreated into.   Therefore, having taken into account Arjuna\u2019s mental make-up, knowing fully well that like us, Arjuna still had a lot of desires, Shri Krishna deemed that karma yoga was the right path for Arjuna, and that he was not well-suited to becoming a monk.   Now, does the follower of karma yoga attain the same result that the follower of renunciation attains? He addressed this point in the upcoming shlokas."

He was quite clear that renunciation of action does not mean running away from action. It means renouncing the agency, or the sense of doership behind the action.   Now, Arjuna still retained a desire to run away from the war against his relatives. So even though Shri Krishna was quite clear that one cannot run away from action, Arjuna was still looking for a way to quit fighting the war. So he interpreted the word \u201crenunciation\u201d to mean what most people think renunciation means: going away to a remote ashram, becoming a monk, and then contemplating upon the eternal essence, casting aside any other worldly responsibilities.   With this interpretation in mind, he wanted to know whether renunciation of action was better than karmayoga. If that were the case, he could run away from the war to a place of contemplation, and gain self-realization following that path. He wanted an unambiguous answer from Shri Krishna because he had already asked this question at the beginning of the third chapter."

        "content": "The journey from the first chapter to the fourth chapter is one of higher and higher levels of integrating or tuning our personality. In the first chapter, we are at the level of selfish action, where we see gain and loss in everything we do. As we move into the second and third chapters, we are introduced to the notion of \u201cnishkaam karma\u201d or desire-less action. Here, we slowly give up attachment to the result of our action by dedicating it to a higher ideal.        In this chapter titled \u201cJnyaana Karma Sanyaasa Yoga\u201d, we move one level higher from desire-less action to agency-less action. What does agency-less action mean? As the key shloka in this chapter indicates, it is the ability to see inaction in action and action in inaction. When we are operating at the level of a karmayogi, we express our desires through performing actions, but we diminish our sense of \u201cmine-ness\u201d or enjoyership by dedicating all the results to Ishvara.         But as we progress on this path, we begin to realize that all actions happen through Maaya, also known as prakriti or nature. Even actions like the surgeon conducting surgery happen through Maaya, upon closer inspection. We realize that the I, the eternal essence, is just the witness. The I does not do anything. This is agency-less action. Our sense of doership or \u201cI-ness\u201d begins to diminish as well.        Ultimately everything is yajnya in brahman. This is a very deep and subtle means of looking at the world. To help us practice developing this vision, Shri Krishna gives us simpler yajnyas such as restraining our senses, worship of a deity and so on. But the end goal is jnaana yagnya or the sacrifice of knowledge. The next chapter goes into more detail about the characteristics  that we have to develop in order to be able to realize this very subtle  and deep vision.        This chapter also gives us a glimpse of Ishvara, the cosmic power and intelligence that controls this universe. Although beyond birth and imperishable, that power manifests itself whenever there is an extreme disharmony in the universe, restores harmony and becomes unmanifest again."

In other words, he asks the students of the Gita to put the teaching of the fourth chapter into practice, and to act in this world.   Shri Krishna reiterates the location of our accumulated ignorance. He uses the word \u201chritstham\u201d which literally means heart, but actually refers to the four-fold antaha-karana comprising the mind, intellect, memory and ego.   This shloka also provides a concise summary of the fourth chapter. Ignorance in the form of individuality, selfishness and finitude, is our natural condition. This ignorance causes us to question our relationship with the world, just like Arjuna got confused in regards to his duty as a warrior. Having gained knowledge, in the form of universality, selflessness and infinitude, we know exactly how to transact with the world. All our doubts are destroyed. We begin to act in a spirit of yajnya, where we see the same eternal essence in the actor, the action and the result. Ultimately, like the shloka says, we arise not just physically, but also spiritually, into a new level of consciousness.   om tatsatiti shrimadbhagavadgitasu upanishadsu brahmavidyayaam yogashastre shrikrishnaarjunasamvade   jnyaanakarmasanyaasayogonaamo chaturthodhyaahaha || 4 ||"

He re-emphasizes that one who follows the path of karma-sanyaasa, or renunciation of action, is liberated from all bondage. He refers to Arjuna as Dhananjaya, which means conqueror of wealth, because Arjuna had accumulated massive wealth from conquests of kingdoms. Also, he had gained wealth in the form of knowledge from Shri Krishna.   One who has attained the knowledge of self-realization acts without a sense of doership and enjoyership of action. It is important to note that renunciation of action refers to renunciation of doership and enjoyership, not renunciation of the action itself. Actions continue to happen. Furthermore, this yoga or prescribed methodology needs to be learned from a teacher, it is difficult to learn on one\u2019s own.   Shri Krishna also reiterates the knowledge of self realization dispels all doubts in the seeker\u2019s mind. Till this knowledge is attained, doubts such as who is the doer of action, who is the enjoyer of results, what is the relation of the self to action will remain. One who has gained this knowledge and dispelled all such doubts is called \u201caatmavant\u201d or one who has gained knowledge of our own self.   A classic example here is that the space in a pot thinks that it is the pot. Once it knows that it is space, it immediately realizes that it is not subject to modifications like big or small, brown or white, moving or stationary and so on. From that point on, any change to the pot will not affect the space in the pot. Similarly, once our doubts vanish, our actions will not bind us."

There are three main obstacles: ignorance, lack of faith, and constant doubting.   Fortunate are those who have had the chance to even come across something called spiritual knowledge, scriptures, Gita and so on. But unless one comes across a taste of the scriptures, one spends their entire life totally ignorant of the eternal reality behind the changing world. So it is this ignorance that becomes the obstacle towards the knowledge of self-realization.   Secondly, Shri Krishna says that one who lacks faith will never fully gain this knowledge. As mentioned earlier, we have to possess faith in scriptures, in our teacher, in ourselves and in the truth of the eternal essence until we gain the knowledge of self-realization. Without faith, we will not last in the long and arduous journey.   Finally, the person who doubts everything will also find it difficult to gain knowledge. Now, to be sure, skepticism and inquiry is absolutely important. In fact, it is encouraged by spiritual teachers. But constant doubting without taking efforts to resolve those doubts will become a huge roadblock in gaining spiritual knowledge.   Shri Krishna also says that constant doubting is not just an obstacle on the spiritual path. It also prevents us from living peacefully in the material world. Each time we board a train or a plane, we implicitly have faith that the driver will take us to our destination safely. If we constantly doubt the capability of the driver, we will never be able to go about our daily business."

He point out three attributes : faith, focus, and sense control.   The most important qualification that we should have is shraddha, or faith. But what specifically should we have faith in? It is four things: faith in scriptures, in our teacher, in ourselves and in the truth of the eternal essence. Furthermore, this faith has to come out of utter conviction that the material world is not the be-all and end-all. There is an changeless eternal reality behind this ever-changing material world. Unless we are convinced that there is something beyond the material world, we will never develop true faith.   However, we have to be careful not to get stuck at level of faith. If our faith becomes too rigid and is guided by dogma rather than intellectual questioning, it will morph into superstition and fanaticism. Just like we learn to appreciate a technical subject such as algebra through inquiry and verification, so too should our faith use the same means to strengthen itself.   In addition to faith, Shri Krishna mentions two more attributes. First is tatparah, which is the keen intent and focus of the seeker to do what it takes to pursue the path chosen. Second is samyatindriyah, which is restraint and control over the senses. If sense restraint is absent, then our attention would quickly stray away from the spiritual path into the material world.   Now, if we develop these qualities and follow the path of knowledge, then we will know that we have gained knowledge through attainment of everlasting peace. As long as the ego is present, it generates noise or chatter in the form of selfish thoughts. It is like the background noise generated by our fridge that we have gotten used to. Knowledge of self-realization annihilates the ego, which eliminates the ego\u2019s noise, giving us everlasting peace. Ultimately, we are all seeking peace, which is beyond happiness."

He also says that this knowledge is ultimately discovered by the seeker in himself through his own efforts. The two key points to note here that the seeker finds it (a) by his own efforts, and (b) in himself.   Many seekers run to teacher after teacher in hopes of self realization. They \u201ctry\u201d a teacher for a while, then go to another one if it doesn\u2019t work out. Shri Krishna reminds us that ultimately, it is our own effort, focus and motivation that will help us get the knowledge. The teacher is no doubt needed to guide us in the right direction. But the effort to purify ourselves through various yanjyaas is ours to put in, no one else can do the hard work for us. Once we develop the right qualities of a sincere seeker and become proficient in whatever spiritual practice that we follow, knowledge will come automatically.   Furthermore, this knowledge is not something that is outside of us. Academic and spiritual literature certainly helps, but true knowledge always comes from within. Shri Krishna also gently warns us that this knowledge will not come instantly, nor will it take thousands of years. It will come when we are ready.   Who is fit for attaining this knowledge?

But does that mean that the sins remain hidden somewhere? In this shloka, he says that all sins or karmaas get destroyed with knowledge. Just as fire has the capability to burn fuel in the form of wood or coal into ashes, so does knowledge totally destroy karmaas.   Karmaas accumulate in our psyche due to ignorance of our true identity. Now, knowledge and ignorance are mutually exclusive. One cannot remain when the other is present. Take an example from early school. Once you what the addition symbol \u201c+\u201d does, you no longer get confused when you see a question on addition.   So when knowledge comes, ignorance is destroyed, as well as karmaas that were created a result of ignorance. And when the sense of doership and enjoyership vanishes, then situations do not cause joy or sorrow. No more karmaas are accumulated.

He says that this knowledge has the power of destroying all of our sins completely, regardless of how many sins we committed in the past.   Let\u2019s re-examine what is meant by sin here using an example. Two most common sins are stealing and harming someone. In both these cases, the physical act itself is not the sin. It is the ego, the assertion of individuality and superiority behind each act, that is the real sin.         This sense of separation created by the ego causes us to commit these acts, and experience joy and sorrow as a result. Over the course of our living, we have accumulated a large number of karmas.   Shri Krishna says here that the knowledge gained through sacrifice will destroy all sins. How will this happen? This will happen because the sinner himself will be annihilated through this knowledge. The sinner is nothing but the ego, the notion of individuality created by the false sense of identification with the finite body, mind and intellect.   This annihilation of the ego is comparable to deletion of an email account. An email account is nothing but a persona created in the virtual world. It can receive regular emails as well as spam emails. But when the email account itself is deleted, it will no longer be the recipient of any kind of email, regular or junk.   So therefore, Shri Krishna paints a beautiful picture to deliver this message. He says that we can cross over the river of all our sins with the boat of knowledge."

In this shloka, he provides a test by which we know whether we have truly gained this knowledge or not. He says that this knowledge totally transforms our vision. It gives us whole new way to view the world.   Imagine we are at a social gathering. We are introduced to a new person, someone whom we have never met before. At that point, we try to size up that person and are not quite sure how the conversation will go. But when we find out that both of us went to the same school for 8 years, we instantly connect with that person. The sense of separation between us and that person diminishes just a little.   Now, take this destruction of separation to its logical extreme where we see all things \u2013 plants, rocks, animals, humans \u2013 as a part of our own self. Everything is connected to each other. Furthermore, we realize that in essence, distinct entities such as plants and animals are not really distinct. There is only one Ishvaraa but appearing as many forms. This is the grand vision after having obtained this knowledge.   So therefore, having gained this knowledge, our moha or delusion with regards to who we are, what is our correct relationship with the world, what are our duties, what is good and bad \u2013 all these questions are answered with this vision of the world. After having this vision, our actions in the wold continue, but they do not accumulate any further karmaas because we are in tune with the world."

Here, he describes the method through which we should go about pursuing that knowledge.   Shri Krishna says that we should begin by approaching a teacher who has two key qualities. One, he should be a tattva-darshinaha. He should have realized the eternal essence himself first-hand. Second, he should be a jnyaaninaha, one who knows the technique of communicating this knowledge. Both qualities are essential and complementary. One without the another will not work.   Having approached the teacher, we should first completely surrender ourselves to him and accept him as our teacher. If we don\u2019t do so then our ego comes into the mix and disrupts everything. The teachings will have no impact if such a thing occurs. We see this type of behaviour when someone approaches a teacher and ends up using that meeting to boast about one\u2019s own knowledge rather than surrender to the teacher.   Next, we should have a thirst for inquiry about the eternal essence, which will be reflected by the questions we ask the teacher. Questions like: Who am I? How do I free myself of bondage? This is what the teacher should be able to answer. All our scriptures including the Upanishads, the Gita and the Bhagavatam are a dialogue between a teacher and student. Furthermore, we should not question about worldly matters like should I get married, should I take this job and so on. Liberation should be top priority.   Finally, we should continue building a relationship with the teacher through serving him. This will foster humility in us. It will also built a better connection and tuning between the teacher and the student. In the Gita, both Arjuna and Dhritaraashtra heard the Gita, but only Arjuna truly understood it. This is because Arjuna was in tune with Shri Krishna and Dhritaraashtra was not. Also, there is absolutely no room for a transactional or \u201ccoaching class\u201d relationship between the teacher and student. Service is the only way.   Even Sant Jnyaaneshwar gained knowledge by serving his guru Nivruttinaath. He says \u201cyogiraaja vinavane mana aale vo maaye\u201d which means \u201cI gained realization by serving my guru yogiraaja Nivruttinaatha\u201d."

Another interpretation, but on similar lines, is that the yajnya of knowledge is the only one that leads us to the path of shreyas or bliss, rather than the path of preyas or the pleasant.   We learned about the sacrifice of knowledge in an earlier shloka. In this yajnya, we go through three steps to acquire the right understanding and knowledge through study of the scriptures: shravana, manana, nidhidhyaasana. Shravana is listening with complete attention. Manana is deep contemplation on the teachings. Nidhidhyaasana is internalizing the teachings through concentration and meditation.   So why is the sacrifice of knowledge better than the other sacrifices? Shri Krishna offers the answer in the second line of the shloka. He says that all actions culminate in knowledge. If we add the context of karmayoga to this sentence, the meaning becomes : all selfishness that motivates actions completely ends in the realization of infinitude. It is like a river that stops flowing when it reaches, or realizes, the ocean.   Let\u2019s dig into this a little deeper. What does it mean to end selfishness? It means that the notion of doership and enjoyership ends. No more does one think \u201cI am doing this\u201d and \u201cI have obtained the result\u201d. Furthermore, this knowledge is permanent. It is not a finite material object like the result of any other yajnya like material yajnya and so on.   Therefore, when we truly understand this highest knowledge that everything is the eternal essence, we identify with infinite and permanent, thereby ending our sense of finitude. Once that happens, we continue performing all our actions. However, all selfish motives behind those actions will have completely vanished."

In this section, we came across many varieties of yajnya. There are several more types of yajnyas in the scriptures such as pilgrimages, how to perform poojas during certain festivals, chanting of japas and so on. With the guidance of a teacher, we can choose the one that works best for us and follow it diligently.   Having concluded this section, Shri Krishna now makes a very important point. He says that while performing these yajnyas, we should never forget that any yajnya is ultimately an action. We saw earlier that actions are performed by the gunaas of prakriti. And anything that is related to gunaas is distinct from the eternal essence. So, how can yajynas move us closer to liberation if they are in the realm of gunaas?   Another way of looking at this issue is as follows. Anything that is a result of action will always be finite by definition. We are looking for realization of the eternal essence which is infinite. How will yajnyaas, born out of finite action, make us obtain the infinite eternal essence?   The key point to understand here is that action does not yield realization, only knowledge can do so. Performance of yajnya is a preparatory step towards realization, just like we prepare for sleep in the night. We can lie down on the bed, we can drink a cup of hot milk, we can turn off the light and so on. But the onset of sleep happens on its own. Similarly, even if we perform yajnyaas, realization will happen when we gain the knowledge when we are not the doer or enjoyer of any actions."

Let\u2019s take a practical example. Suppose we decide to follow the yajnya of nityaahaarah. In other words, we decide to restrict our food intake. How do we actually implement this? Shri Krishna tells us that in all actions that we undertake, we should first perform the yajyna, and then partake of the \u201cremnants\u201d of the yajnya.   So if we see a tasty dish, we perform a yajnya on the spot by saying \u201cI am performing a yajnya. I first offer all the food to Ishvara because this food belongs to Ishvara. I will take only x amount for myself as the remnants of that yajnya.\u201d The key point here is we first perform the yajnya, then partake of the fruit of the action. We do not rush directly into the action. This lets our intellect override the impulses of our senses.   If we truly make yajnya spirit a part of our life, we will develop \u201cpraasada buddhi\u201d, which is one of the cornerstones of karma yoga. Since the praasaada is a gift from Ishvaraa, we will not compare it to someone else\u2019s prasaada. In doing so, we will subdue negative emotions such as jealousy and insecurity. Over time, we will find inner joy in conducting such yajnyas every day. This inner joy is called \u201camrita\u201d or nectar in this shloka. It will have the power of negating all our sorrows.   One who does not maintain the attitude of yajnya goes against the laws of nature, as it were. This is because the yajnya spirit pervades the entire universe, as we have seen earlier. Such a person lives an unhappy existence even in the material world, and has no chance of attaining any spiritual goals whatsoever."

In this shloka, he describes a yajnya where one not only controls the quality of sensory intake but also the quantity. Although this is applicable to all senses such as smell, taste, sight and so on, let us consider one which is the simplest to understand: taste. Dieting becomes a form of yajnya.   By controlling or regulating the intake of food, we can control our mind. Our body and mind is ultimately made up of the food we consume. Later in the seventeenth chapter, Shri Krishna describes different types of food. For now, let us consider three main types. Saatvic food is that which is conducive to mind, which creates harmony in our system. Raajasic food makes us more active. It is usually spicy to taste. Taamasic food makes us dull, sleepy and sometimes intoxicated as well. It is food that has lost all its nutritional value, and is usually stale. It is also known as junk food.   On a subtler level, food also acquires the characteristics of how it has been prepared. At some level, we can always tell whether the food we eat has been mass produced, or has been made with care and attention. That is why many serious students of meditation will usually prepare their own food.   So therefore, Shri Krishna says here that we can perform yajnya by restricting our sensory intake. Now, let\u2019s look at the deeper meaning of this shloka. By regulating the intake of our senses, we reduce our dependence on the senses and in doing so, offer them senses back to the universe. In parallel, our life forces also do not need to work hard in order to digest and process all this sensory \u201cfood\u201d that we consume. Therefore, we also offer our life force back to the universal or cosmic life force. In other words, we say \u201cHere, please take these senses and life force back. It is your property to begin with. It is not mine.\u201d"

It is to be noted that it no practice of praanaayam should be undertaken without the supervision of a teacher, otherwise it can be harmful.   As we saw earlier, praanaas are the life energies within us that enable all our bodily functions including breathing, digestion, circulation and so on. Moreover, they function as the link between the mind and the body. We know that if our mind is upset all the time, our body develops psychosomatic illnesses due to the praanaas linking the mind and the body.   Since our mind and body are connected via the praanaas, we control the mind by controlling the praanaas. In praanaayaam, one regulates the breathing pattern (breathe in \u2013 retain \u2013 breathe out) as well as the time interval between each breath. This regulation has a direct impact on the mind. Even without studying pranaayaam, we can see that a few minutes of observing our normal breath helps to quieten the mind.   In this manner, Shri Krishna adds yet another yajnya to the list of yajnyas that one should pursue in order to gradually develop the ultimate vision that everything is the eternal essence."

First, he talks about the sacrifice of wealth, or as it is more commonly known \u2013 charity. As we saw in the second chapter, lobha or the tendency to hoard can destabilize our mind, and strengthen the ego. Therefore, giving away wealth or even our time to a higher ideal checks this tendency to hoard. But charity has to be done with the attitude that I am giving away what was not mine to begin with. If one donates with a view to gain publicity and so on, that is a selfish or rajasic type of charity.   Secondly, Shri Krishna mentions austerity or tapas. In this type of yajyna, the urge of the sense organs to go out into the world is checked, so that the ego is weakened. There are three avenues for conducting tapas: the body, senses and mind. In physical tapas, we use the energy of our body to do seva or service the world. In sense-related tapas, we keep a strong leash on our senses and organs. For example, we can practice austerity on speech by always speaking truth, saying what\u2019s beneficial to someone, and creating disturbance in anybody\u2019s mind. In mental tapas, we control our mind by not giving attention to negative thoughts and emotions, and not letting others trigger such emotions in us.   Third, Shri Krishna gives us the option of practicing a detailed regimen of spiritual practice or yoga. It could be bhakti yoga (which we will see later), karma yoga, raaja yoga of Patanjali and so on.   Finally, we can practice study of the scriptures, which is also known as jnyaana yajnya. A daily reading of the Gita, Ramayana or any other such spiritual text with utmost attention, concentration, understanding and discipline is also a yajnya. Here also, the ego becomes weak because the intellect gains a firmer and stronger position in relation to the ego, strengthened by daily exposure to the scriptures.   The common thread of all the yajnyas mentioned is that of weakening the hold of the ego, which is nothing but weakening of the notion of \u201cI-ness\u201d and \u201cmine-ness\u201d."

In this shloka, he describes a technique for more advanced seekers where one not just restrains the senses, but also restrains the life forces or praana within our body. This discipline is the raaja yoga of Patanjali. It begins with the three limbs of yama, niyama and aasana that we saw in the previous sholka. Let us examine one key aspect of this technique, which is understanding of praana.   Praanaas are energy systems within our body that sustain physiological processes. There are five types of praana : praana, apaana, udaana, vayaana and samaana. Just like restraining the senses conserves energy that can be redirected towards advancing spiritually, so too can restraining the praanaas lead to the same outcome. However, this technique requires the guidance of a teacher and is not recommended for self-experimentation.   The senses and the praanaas are like rays of the sun emanating from our self. So as the yogi progresses in this yajnya, he regulates the praanaas using praanaayaam, the fifth limb of the raaja yoga technique which is described a later shloka. He then withdraws attention from senses and from the praanas, and redirects the energy towards concentration or dhyaana on the eternal essence, which is the sixth limb of Patanjali yoga. He then progresses to uninterrupted concentration or dhaarana, the seventh limb. Eventually, he attains direct perception of the eternal essence. This ultimate state is known as samaadhi, the eight and final limb of Patanjali yoga.   Knowing fully well that most of us need more basic techniques, Shri Krishna gives us a whole range of options in the next shloka."

In the first yajyna, we use our discrimination to limit the activities of our senses. Symbolically, self control is like the fire to which the senses are offered.   The world comprises both good and bad influences. Our senses are exposed to thousands of such influences each day. If we keep senses open all the time without proper discrimination, so many negative influences would enter that it would take a lifetime to clean them up. Therefore, in this yajnya, we exercise our discretion over what we see, eat and hear everyday. Such withdrawal of energy from the senses is called pratyaahaara. It is the fourth \u201climb\u201d or aspect of yoga in the tradition of Patanjali, the first three being yama (restraint), niyama (positive restraint, covered in a later shloka) and aasana (steadying the body).   The Ramaayana illustrates this very well with the example of Raavana and Dasharatha. Raavana\u2019s ten heads are representative of the ten senses (5 sense organs + 5 organs of action). He was under such influence of his senses, he used them so much for enjoyment that they became ten heads. Conversely, Dasharatha exerted such control over his senses that they led him to his destination like a chariot (ratha).   The second yagnya is a more sophisticated version of the first yagnya. Instead of offering the senses to the fire of self restraint, the objects themselves, or more accurately, the notion of an object is sacrificed. We had come across the example of a gold jeweller who is only interested in the weight of the jewellery, regardless of how beautiful the ornament is. Similarly, advanced yogis sacrifice the notion that they are living in the world of objects. They recognize that objects are nothing but configurations of the same three cosmic forces: sattva, rajas and tamas. Like the jeweller, they \u201cmelt\u201d the object so that it no longer draws their self outward."

This person thinks of brahman in everything and every action that he performs; it is 24/7, every second. For seekers who have just begin their journey, such a grand vision is difficult to consistently maintain. So in the following shlokas, Shri Krishna gives us simpler forms of worship for practice, so that we can ultimately build ourselves up to this grand vision.   For most of us it is difficult to comprehend the formless brahman. Therefore, many yogis worship a deity, in other words they invoke Ishvaraa in a particular idol or photograph. This offering of services to Ishvaraa is called \u201cpooja\u201d. Now in pooja, imagination plays an important role. Just like children play the house house game \u2013 the better the imagination, better they enjoy it. The process of pooja helps us develop rapport with Ishvaraa.   Once we get into the habit of pooja, we then imagine Ishvaraa in every action that we perform. We can even imagine Ishvaraa in the form of our friend, brother, parents and so on. It helps us to purify our mind and reduce fear caused by our attachments. As our trust in Ishvaraa increases, our fear decreases and we become calmer.   In addition to seekers who worship Ishvaraa, there is another group of seekers that are more thought oriented and more contemplative. They strive to realize the formless brahman through inquiry, contemplation, meditation, and by understanding their oneness with brahman. This form of worship is called jnyaana saadhanaa or spiritual practice through knowledge. It is like the wave surrendering completely to the ocean to realize its oneness with the ocean.   As we study the different forms of yagnyas that we can practice, it is easy to get carried away by the variety and the details. But the key point to remember is this. Any action we perform as part of a yagnya must not ever have even a tinge of expectation of result. If that happens, the yagnya becomes an ordinary, selfish action. The goal is to get better at these practice yagnyas so that we can bring that yagnya spirit into all actions in our daily life."

If we truly perform all actions in this world with a an attitude of yajnya, not just some actions, our vision of the world changes. In this shloka, Shri Krishna uses the ritual of a yajnya to paint a picture of what this ultimate vision looks like. We begin to see brahman, the eternal essence, in everything.   Six components of a yajyna ritual are pointed out here. The act of yajnya, the offering (usually butter or milk), the ladle used to submit the offering, the sacrificial flame, the person who performs the yajnya, and the goal that the person wishes to attain. Shri Krishna says that all six components of yajyna are nothing but the eternal essence.   This example can be interpreted from several perspectives. Let\u2019s first examine it from a purely physical perspective. The ladle is made of wood, which has come from the earth, and so has the offering. The person who performs the yajnya is created out of food, which also has come out of the earth. The flame and the act of yajnya are both manifestations of cosmic forces. Their ultimate cause can be traced back to the cosmic big bang. The goal has as a thought in the mind of the person, a mind that also has come from nature.   Now, how can we make it more concrete? Consider a computer programmer writing a software application. What should his vision become? The act of programming, the code he writes, the computer he uses to write the code, the software application that his code becomes a part of, his goal of writing good code, and the programmer himself \u2013 everything is the eternal essence. This is \u201cbrahma-drishti\u201d or the vision of brahman that is achieved while interacting in this world.   In many Indian households, people chant this shloka prior to eating a meal as a reminder that the food, the body and the act of eating \u2013 all are nothing but brahman."

Shri Krishna says that if we make the yajnya spirit a part of our life, rather than implement it only in work projects, it has the power to destroy all our vaasanaas. In this shloka, he tells Arjuna that for the person who is totally detached, free from attachments and established in the eternal essence, all of his accumulated karmaas melt away, like ice before the sun.   As we learned earlier, we perform selfish actions as a result of an unhealthy relationship with the world. Each such selfish action generates a negative reaction from the world which accumulates in our psyche as a karma. The way out of this predicament is correct knowledge, which is nothing but a healthy relationship with the world where all traces of selfishness are gone, where one works in a spirit of yajnya. This attitude of yajnya slowly makes us lose our identification with the body, mind, intellect and material objects. As our attachment goes away, we become liberated individuals.   Shri Krishna concludes the current topic of practical karmayoga advice by assuring us that the fire of knowledge burns the masses of karma that we have accumulated, provided that our actions are totally unselfish."

Shri Krishna guides us on how to deal with these situations in this shloka.   By definition, karma yoga inspires us to work relentlessly. The output of our project may be sometimes favourable, and sometimes not. The follower of karma yoga knows that he is one of the many variables that determine the output of his work, and is therefore content with whatever comes his way. He does not let unfavourable outcomes impact his level of work. This is the \u201cprasaada buddhi\u201d that we say earlier.   Favourable and unfavourable, success and failure, heat and cold, praise and criticism \u2013 this is duality. It arises because our minds tends to label one aspect of nature as positive, and reject the other as negative. But the follower of karma yoga knows that nothing is absolutely good or bad. It is all part of Ishvaraa and therefore remains equanimous. This is nothing but \u201csamatva buddhi\u201d.   Our mind has a natural tendency to compare ourselves with others like us. If it perceives us \u201cbetter\u201d than others, it generates pride. If it perceives us \u201cinferior\u201d to others, it generates envy. The follower of karma yoga knows that ultimately we are all part of the same higher ideal \u2013 Ishvaraa. Any envy generated in the mind only strengthens the ego. So he never lets envy distract him         from his work. It is a quality that he does not encourage.   So the refrain here is that such a follower of karma yoga will continue to perform actions in this world, yet remain unattached because he never lets external situations destabilize his equanimity."

The reality is that nature produced the raw materials, as well as the knowledge to convert those into these objects. We did not \u201cdo\u201d anything.   It has to be noted that there is no need to give up possessions. That is not the meaning here. Our attitude towards our possessions should be like a renter versus an owner. We should take care of possessions but not be bound to them. Slowly, as our possessive thinking diminishes, our actions also reduce. We then care only about our svadharma, and on keeping our mind and body fit for service.

In this shloka, Shri Krishna says that everlasting happiness and contentment is a natural byproduct of karma yoga itself, not of any one particular project. Contentment becomes part of our personality. The word used to describe this state is \u201cnityatriptah\u201d.   As we grow up, we are programmed and conditioned by the world to believe that happiness is something that is outside of us. This conditioning goes deep inside our psyche and causes us to run after a better job, more money, a bigger house and so on. Now, it is absolutely alright to pursue growth while performing one\u2019s svadharma. Wealth follows naturally if one follows svadharma sincerely. But constant seeking of happiness from external objects makes us slavishly dependent upon the world.   What is so wrong about this seemingly normal tendency to look outside oneself for happiness? Because any happiness gained from the world will be finite and temporary. But Shri Krishna says here that if one dependent on the eternal essence instead, he becomes ever content. As the second chapter says: \u201cnaabhaavo vidyate sataha\u201d. The self is infinite and eternal.   Through karmayoga, we lose our attachment to the results of our actions. In doing so, we become less dependent on external world for happiness. Shri Krishna asks us to use our discrimination to examine the source of our happiness. We should train our mind to check daily whether we have gone outside ourselves to search for happiness, or is it coming from within.   Furthermore, if we are attached to the result of our action, we generate a expectation for the future. Which means that we identify ourselves with the process of time, which is also a part of prakriti. Identification with time accumulates karma or negative reaction from the universe.   So therefore, one who does not create expectation of a result in the future does not accumulate karma. This is what is meant by the phrase \u201cnever does anything\u201d in the shloka."

But after a while, it will get distracted and tend to wander towards material objects. This distraction will eventually lead to lack of efficiency in our project. Shri Krishna addresses how to deal with this aspect of the mind.   The common meaning of the word \u201csankalpa\u201d is decision or resolve. Let\u2019s examine the deeper meaning. Whenever we think about an object, there is a constant labelling going on in our mind on whether the object is \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d. After having gone back and forth, we label something as \u201cgood\u201d. This labelling is called sankalpa.   Why does this labelling happen? It is because our intellect has been superseded by our mind and senses. For example, a bitter medicine may benefit the body holistically. The intellect knows this. But the sense of taste will not like it. Furthermore, this sankalpa or labelling gives rise to kaama, or desire for that object. And herein lies the seed of selfish action that distracts us from the goal. Sankalpa and kaama are interrelated, any one of them indicates the present of the other, but both give rise to selfish action.   Therefore, Shri Krishna urges us to \u201cburn\u201d our selfish actions with the fire of knowledge. In other words, he wants our intellect to guide us in our svadharma, and stop the mind from labelling objects as good or bad. If something comes to us as part of our svadharma, we must accept it with prasaada buddhi. Like the lotus that remains in the pond and is untouched by the water, we must continually remind ourselves that our eternal essence is different and separate from all actions. Actions are going on by themselves in nature. Therefore, we should remain alert at all times, and should reinstate the supremacy of the intellect over the senses whenever the senses move towards external objects."

        "content": "karmanyakarma yaha pashyedakarmani cha karma yaha |   sa buddhimaanmanushyeshu sa yuktaha kritsnakarmakrit || 18 ||   One who sees inaction in action, and action in inaction, he is wise among all people, he is well integrated and accomplishes his actions.   karmani : in action   akarma : inaction   yaha : one who   pashyet : sees   akarmani : in in action   cha : and   karma : action   yaha : who   saha : he is   buddhimaan : wise   manushyeshu : among people   saha : he is   yuktaha : a yogi (well integrated)   kritsnakarmakrit : accomplishes all actions   Now, having understood the deeper meaning of karma, let us look at the most crucial shlokas of this chapter. Shri Krishna employs his poetic prowess to teach us how to apply the knowledge of karma to our actions. He uses the words karma and akarma (action and inaction) differently in different parts of the shloka, so let us take it part by part.   First, let us understand what is meant by \u201cseeing inaction in action\u201d. The word action in this phrase refers to activity of any sort: thinking, feeling, working. To be clear, even thinking a thought is action. And the word \u201cinaction\u201d here refers to the constant awareness that the eternal essence, our self, is inactive, and not the doer of action. It means complete detachment from the work and detachment from a sense of agency or doership, because the mind has now attached itself to a higher ideal.   So therefore, one who sees inaction in action knows that his every activity is happening out of prakriti or nature. His true identity is the eternal essence that neither does any action not enjoys the result of any action. From a practical standpoint, it refers to the attitude that we have towards our work. It is the difference between a worker who can perform tough tasks and not feel tired, and the worker who feels that every minute of his work is a burden.   Next, let us look at the phrase \u201cseeing action in inaction\u201d. The word action in this phrase refers to the ego, the notion that \u201cI am the doer\u201d as well as the sense of agency in the work. And the word \u201cinaction\u201d refers to absence of activity. So for example, if someone needs help crossing the road and we think \u201cI won\u2019t help him because I will be late for my bus\u201d. Behind our absence of helping someone cross the road is a selfish motive. Similarly, if we hold back on admitting a mistake that we had committed, our absence of admitting our guilt is driven by a selfish motive. This is seeing action in inaction.   Shri Krishna then goes on to say that one who constantly uses his discrimination to eliminate all sense of doership from every action \u2013 that person is wise and is well integrated in the yajna spirit. That person will accomplish any task that he takes up without fail. His success is guaranteed.   The following four shlokas describe the attributes of such an integrated person, similar to the characteristics of a wise person from the second chapter."

Previously, we examined the meaning of karma as selfish actions, and akarma as unselfish actions. Now let\u2019s look at what is meant by vikarma. Vikarma or forbidden action refers to any action that is not prescribed in one\u2019s svadharma. We need to use our intellect to determine what is vikarma based on our individual situation.   For example, one could be a vaishya (businessman). His duty is to conduct business and use the earnings for benefit of family and for the benefit society as a whole. There is absolutely no harm if he wants to earn more and more wealth. It is absolutely ok as long as he is using it for the benefit of family and society.   But if one is a student, his goal should be to diligently acquire knowledge. If his attention is diverted towards acquiring more girlfriends, that becomes vikarma. The key point here is that no outside entity can tell someone what their svadharma is. It has to come from within, from deep self examination and analysis.   Having examined the definitions of karma, akarma and vikarma, let us know go one step further and understand karma at a much deeper level. Shri Krishna gently warns us that we need to put forth effort to have a correct understanding of this topic, because it is hard to comprehend. Karma is a reaction produced by nature in response to our relationship to it.   Firstly, let us understand what is mean by our relationship to nature. It goes back to our thoughts and our motives. If we are motivated by a selfish spirit, nature will give us a negative reaction, just like electricity gives us a shock if we handle it improperly. Conversely, if we are motivated by a spirit of cooperation and selflessness, we will not get that negative reaction from nature.   Why so? Because we have seen earlier that the spirit of yajna is embedded in nature itself. Prakriti or nature is moving with the yajna spirit, and we are part of nature itself. So therefore, if our thoughts and feelings \u2013 not just our actions \u2013 are \u201cin tune\u201d with nature and the spirit of yajna, we will not accumulate negative reactions or karma.   Next, let us understand where these reactions come from. They do not come from some outside agency that constantly monitors our actions and gives us karma \u201cpoints\u201d. These reactions come from nature itself. Nature is like a mirror \u2013 if you smile at it, it smiles right back. We have all heard the saying \u201cwhat goes around comes around\u201d. That is karma.   So what does it mean for us from a practical perspective? We have to constantly use our viveka or discrimination to ensure our thoughts and feelings are working in the spirit of yajna. If our thoughts are unselfish, so too will our actions be unselfish. Otherwise, we will go on accumulating karma which gets lodged in our personality as vaasanaa, which is the very thing that stands between us and self-realization."

With this shloka, Shri Krishna alerts us that the upcoming shlokas will give us a much deeper understanding of the topic of karma or action.   Let us recap what we have learned so far about action and inaction. Action or karma as defined by Shri Krishna is any activity performed with a selfish motive. Inaction or akarma is defined as any activity performed in a selfless manner. In other words, with a yajnya spirit. It is important to revise these definitions because Shri Krishna says that even intelligent people very easily get confused by this terminology, since action typically means any activity and inaction means absence of activity.   Why is this topic important? Unless our intellect fully understands and gets the conviction that we can achieve self-realization through performance of action, we will again and again fall prey to the wrong notion that we should renounce everything.   This is evident in our daily lives. Whenever we feel pressure at our job, we start thinking about changing jobs. If we have to resolve a delicate issue impacting our friends or relatives, we may try to defer or avoid it altogether rather than addressing it. We have an inbuilt tendency to avoid performing actions, even though all our bodies can do is perform action. Therefore, Shri Krishna wants us to have a thorough understanding of the nature of action so that it becomes a part of our life, than something that we just read about."

These ancient seekers understood that the \u201cI\u201d is the eternal essence. It is not the doer and does not have anything to gain from results of actions. So they continued to perform actions, dedicating them to the highest ideal which is Ishvaraa, and purified their minds doing so.   Shri Krishna also re-emphasizes that this teaching did not deter the ancient seekers from performing actions, in other words, they did not abandon their duties and retire to the forest. They continued to work in the world but maintained the karmayoga attitude.   By pointing out the heritage of karmayoga, Shri Krishna constantly reminded Arjuna that this is not a brand new teaching, it always was a way of life but was lost due to the passage of time."

First he gave the paramparaa or tradition of the teaching. He then revealed his nature as Ishvaraa, and explained the method by which he manifests as an avataara. Finally, he explained how he responds in the exact manner that one approaches him.   As we get further into karmayoga, we slowly begin to lost our attachment to the fruits of our action, which is the first stage in karmayoga. In this chapter, Shri Krishna urges us to move to the next stage in this journey where we begin to lose the notion of doership.To highlight this point, Shri Krishna says that as Ishvaraa, even he knows that actions are happening in prakriti, and therefore he is not the doer of those actions, but he is beyond all action. He puts this poetically by saying that actions do not \u201cstain\u201d him.   Why is Ishvara beyond all action? At its core, any action happens when there is an imbalance or vacuum. Wind travels from high pressure areas to low pressure areas. Electric current moves when there is a difference in voltage. The mind creates a thought because of our vaasanaas. But Ishvara is all-complete and self-sufficient. Therefore, he does not need to act. He is only a witness.   If there is a reflection of the sun in a pond, and if dirt is thrown on the pond, the sun is not stained by that dirt. Similarly, since actions are performed by prakriti, there is no impact to Ishvaraa. In this and other shlokas of this chapter, Shri Krishna reminds us that just like he knows that he is not the doer or enjoyer of actions, so should we have the exact same conviction."

So how can we achieve liberation from bondage while still performing action? To that end, Shri Krishna advises us to act per our svadharma. By efficiently performing svadharma, we can liberate ourselves while performing actions. This is the \u201cwhy\u201d of karmayoga.   Knowing that one should perform one\u2019s svadharma or duty in this world is core to karmayoga. But how does one know what is one\u2019s svadharma? Shri Krishna addresses this point briefly in this shloka. He says that human beings are categorized into four classes or varnaas. These classes are based on the 3 gunaas, and the corresponding action that each guna prompts us to do.   The three gunas and their corresponding actions are as follows. Rajas is expressed as as activity or agitation. Tamas is expressed as lethargy or laziness. Sattva is expressed as knowledge and peace. So we have to perform self-analysis in order to understand how the gunaas behave within us and in what proportion to each other.   We will find that we will fall into one of these four categories. A brahmana who is predisposed to gaining knowledge, faith, sharing knowledge will usually have a prominence of sattva. A kshatriya who demonstrates courage, likes to organize and protect people, face challenges, take risks, try new things will have a prominence of sattva and rajas. A vaishya who likes to be creative and produce something will have a prominence of rajas and tamas. A shudra who likes to execute tasks but requires a lot of motivation will have prominence of tamas.   As we can tell, this shloka was heavily misinterpreted to support the incorrect notion that varna is determined by birth. There is no such thing. Just like we have career counselling in modern times, the Gita offered a scientific manner of selecting a career that is suitable for oneself both from a practical perspective, and also from a karma yoga perspective.   In the second part of the shloka, Shri Krishna reminds us that although he has set up this classification of varnaa, he is not the doer even in this act. It is maayaa alone that is acting in this world, whereas he is only the witness to its actions. We can think of ourselves as playing different parts in a cosmic play. Each part is different based on our svadharma."

He responds in the same manner in which people seek him. So then the question arises? Why don\u2019t people approach him for self-realization? Would they not get it if they ask him?   Shri Krishna says that most of us do not desire self-realization, we only desire material objects because they give us instant happiness. We have been conditioned to perform actions that get quick results. We make instant coffee and it gives us instant satisfaction. And when we want results that are beyond our immediate control, we approach and appease forces in nature that can grant us the result we need. These forces could be human beings \u2013 we may propitiate a local politician if we want to set up a business in a particular town.   But, not matter how satisfying the result is, it will only give us temporary happiness because we have approached a force of nature that is a subset of Ishvaraa. Ishvaraa is the ultimate force in nature. Only he can give us permanent happiness in the form of self-realization.   Moreover, this permanent happiness is not a result of any outward actions. Actions performed in the spirit of karmayoga will no doubt help purify our mind. But the ultimate goal of self-realization is not the result of any outward action, it is only through the removal of ignorance in the form of selfish desire.   If we recall, \u201csamarpana buddhi\u201d or the wisdom of dedicating actions is one of the five main aspects of karmayoga. So therefore, these shlokas deal with the topic of Ishvaraa so that he will become the ultimate ideal to whom we can dedicate all our actions to."

On this note, a doubt may arise: Is he partial to those who take refuge in him, compared to those who do not? He advises us to be free of desires and aversions \u2013 isn\u2019t this an example of aversion towards those who do not take refuge in him?   Shri Krishna responds to this doubt in this shloka. First, he asserts that whenever we have a strong desire, whether it is a material one or a spiritual one, that desire reaches Ishvaraa. If we approach the world with a desire for a promotion in our career, or we want better health, that desire reaches Ishvaraa because the world is part of Ishvaraa. The world is a part of Ishvaraa, as we saw earlier.   Having learned of the desire, how does he respond to the request? He says that he treats all requests like an impersonal computer system. Whatever we input, similar will be the output. If someone truly and deeply desires a promotion, and works hard towards it, he will get it. Similarly, if someone truly and deeply desires moksha, or realization of the eternal essence, and puts in the effort, he will get it.   The power of Ishvaraa is impartial. It is without any prejudice or hatred, just like electricity. One may harness electricity to power a fan, to light a room, to watch television and so on. Electricity will never say \u201cI do not like television, so I will not power it, but I will power the fan\u201d. Ishvaraa\u2019s actions are based on laws, just like the laws of nature."

Having heard this, a question may arise as to how many individuals were successful in realizing the eternal essence by following the path laid out by Shri Krishna. He gives an encouraging answer to that question. He says that many people have attained the eternal essence following this path. They have become \u201cmanmayaahaa\u201d or one with him.   Many of us may have followed the teaching so far, and may have also understood the notion of karmayoga. Assuming that we follow it diligently, we would like to know what comes next in the spiritual journey. We can proceed further, but we cannot force it, just like one cannot go from high school to college without passing exams.   So in this shloka, Shri Krishna gives the roadmap to attaining the eternal essence. First, he advises us to follow the path of karmayoga so that our system is cleared of vaasanaas. It is the preparatory stage in the spiritual path, as we have seen earlier. As we become proficient in karmayoga, we slowly become free of attachment, fear and anger.   Next, as our vaasanaas become weaker, the force of our thought becomes more controlled. Our mind becomes purer, and consequently, becomes still. This enables us to better comprehend, contemplate upon and internalize the statements such as \u201cI am the eternal essence\u201d. Traditionally, these stages are shravana (hearing the scriptures), manana (contemplating) and nidhidhyaasana (internalization).   This constant and continued attempt to achieve identification with the eternal essence through the three stages of shravana, manana and nidhidhyaasana is called \u201cjnyaana tapas\u201d or the austerity of knowledge. We should note that this knowledge is not the kind of academic knowledge that we are used to. It is the absence of ignorance caused by vasanaas, or in other words, absence of selfish thinking.   Finally, having been purified by the austerity of knowledge, we begin to attain an affectionate attitude towards Ishvaraa. This attitude of devotion makes us take ultimate refuge in Ishvaraa, indicated here by the word \u201cmaanupaashritaaha\u201d.   Footnotes   1. This shloka summarizes the three traditional paths of spirituality: karmayoga, bhaktiyoga (devotion) and jnyaanayoga (knowledge)"

Now the question arises: how does this knowledge help the spiritual seeker? He says that once we understand the secret of Ishvaraa\u2019s birth and action, we will understand the secret of our action as well.   What is the secret of Ishvaraa\u2019s birth and action? It looks to us that Ishvaraa is born, and that Ishvaraa performs action. But that is not the case. Through the power of Ishvaraa\u2019s Maaya, it only looks like Ishvaraa takes birth and performs action. It is just an illusion. As we have seen earlier, the eternal essence does not perform action, only prakriti \u2013 also called maaya \u2013 performs action.   Now, the jeeva within us is identified with the body, mind and intellect. Its birth is based on past karmaas. It performs karmaas with a sense of doership. In other words, it thinks that it is performing actions. But from the standpoint of the eternal essence, there is no doership or enjoyership. It is prakriti alone that acts. Just like Ishvaraa does not perform action, the jeeva also does not perform action. The jeeva is one with Ishvaraa.   So therefore, one who truly and completely understands this point will drop identification with his body, and begin identifying with the eternal essence. That is what is meant by the phrase \u201cdeham tvaktvaa\u201d: the jeeva has stopped identification of the body.   Here, academic knowledge is not enough. We need a first-hand understanding that prakriti performs actions and not the eternal essence. That first-hand understanding can only be gained through meditation, which is explained later in the Gita.   A simple way to understand the teaching so far is as follows. The individual jeeva is like a wave in the ocean. Ishvaraa is like the ocean. The eternal essence or brahman is water. Once the wave realizes that it is the same water as Ishvaraa, it is free from the limitations of its tiny form."

It will usually never happen for the benefit of a single individual, city, state or country. It will happen for the sake of the entire creation. And just like sometimes a part of the body needs to be amputated, it could manifest as a tornado or earthquake, causing tremendous destruction. We could also complain that why does not Ishvara manifest himself and fix all the ills of the world that are happening now. The manifestation happens only at the right time, and only when it serves the purpose of the entire universe.   Sant Jnyaneshwar comments elaborately about Ishvaraa\u2019s avataara. He very poetically says that the avataara destroys the kaajal (kohl) of ignorance and lights the lamp of wisdom in the world. Also, he says that even though Shri Krishna commands Maaya in order to manifest himself, he is neither the doer nor the enjoyer of the actions that he performs.

Here he speaks about the reason for manifesting as an avataara. He says that whenever there is a decay in dharma, and a rise in adharma, during that time he manifests himself in a particular form in this world. Now dharma means righteousness, but it also means universal harmony. Adharma then becomes disharmony.   Again, let us take the example of our body. Every cell and organ is working for the totality of the human being. It is the spirit of \u201cone for all and all for one\u201d, which is nothing but the spirit of yajna that we saw earlier. Our heart keeps beating and doesn\u2019t ask for any reward or recognition. It just works for the sake of totality.   But sometimes, a part of the body, or the whole body, undergoes a situation when something goes wrong. Then, the intelligence of the body manifests itself to take care of the situation. If the problem is in one part of the body then special enzymes are secreted to remedy the situation, and white blood cells fight off the invaders. If the problem is in the whole body then it becomes warm under fever in order to get rid of intruders.   Similarly Ishvara comes either for short time like the Narasimha avataara, or for a long time like Shri Krishna avataar. Sometimes we find that the entire population thinks the same thought \u2013 e.g. an independence struggle or a social movement. That is also an avataara. If we go on polluting the environment with chemicals and so on, there could be a natural disaster in response. That is also an avataara ."

He says he is not born into this world like an ordinary human. He wills himself or manifests himself into existence by controlling prakriti, which is made up of the 3 gunaas. The power that causes this manifestation is called maaya. Let us look at two examples to understand this concept further.   Our body has billons of cells that carry our a wide range of functions. Each of these cells behave independently. But they are all working for an entity \u2013 the person \u2013 who is much larger and powerful than all of them put together.   Also consider the wave and the ocean. There are many waves, but all of them are part of a gigantic entity called the ocean. The ocean contains all the waves on the surface, as well as a vast quantity of water that lies under the surface. The wave derives its power from the ocean, but the ocean is more powerful than any one wave.   Similarly, the entire universe is the body of the supreme person known as Ishvara, who is the controller of the universe and the most powerful entity in existence. We are like waves that derive our power from the ocean called Ishvara. The power of Ishvara can be seen in the laws of nature, especially when we see cosmic phenomenon like a supernova explosion. The intelligence of Ishvara can be seen in the harmony of the universe, when we see the vast cosmos with stars, planets, the sun and so on.   Prakriti is related to both us and Ishvara but in different ways. While we are usually under the control of prakriti (the 3 gunaas), it is Ishvara that controls prakriti. It is like a wild horse controlling its rider versus an experienced jockey controlling a race horse. But both Ishvara and us are nothing but the eternal essence, just like the wave and ocean are made up of water. When the eternal essence identifies with a finite body, it is a jeeva. When it identifies with the entire universe, it is Ishvara.   Having grasped the concept of Ishvara, let us know look at the concept of \u201cavataar\u201d or manifestation. Let\u2019s say a small rat tries to invade a large ant colony. Immediately, the entire ant colony springs into action. It is as if there is an \u201cant colony intelligence\u201d that commands ants to collectively attack the rat in order to protect the ant colony. There was no \u201cbirth\u201d of that collective attack, it manifested in response to a situation, and ended as soon as the situation was dealt with.   Similarly, Ishvara has the ability to manifest in the universe. The manifestation could be a short-lived one, like one thought in a person\u2019s mind. It could also be long-living manifestation like a human being in the form of Shri Krishna. Our Puraanic literature describes several avataaras in great detail, but these are only a subset of the countless avataaras that take place over time. An avataara is like a rain-bearing cloud: it materializes out of thin air, does its work, and quietly disappears.   So why does Ishvara need to take an avataara? Shri Krishna covers this topic in the next two oft-quoted shlokas of the Gita."

Previously, Arjuna raised a doubt as to how did Shri Krishna convey the Gita teaching to the sun. Shri Krishna responds by pointing out the similarity as well as the difference between his birth and Arjuna\u2019s birth. The similarity is that both Arjuna and Shri Krishna have taken many births in the past.   However, the difference is that Shri Krishna had the knowledge and memory of all his prior births, whereas Arjuna did not. Normally, human beings have such strong identification with their body that it restricts their ability to remember what occurred in another body. We even tend to forget events associated with our own body with the passage of time, including simple things like where we kept our keys in the morning.   So if Shri Krishna could recall what happened in all his births, he did not have any identification to his body, and therefore he is not restricted by its limitations. He was speaking as an enlightened being who realized the eternal essence and has dropped identification with his body. But there is more to Shri Krishna than just this aspect. He will reveal more in the next shloka.   Footnotes   1. How does the Gita treat the topic of rebirth? Our vaasanaas force us to take a birth in a body. If we chose to use the birth to exhaust those vaasanaas, then the cycle of rebirth is broken. But if we chose to use the birth to accumulate more vaasanaas, then we will be forced to take another birth to exhause the newly acquired vaasanaas. Only by cleansing our vaasanaas can we break the cycle of rebirth or \u201csamsaara\u201d."

Arjuna was of course quite happy to receive it, but why was he chosen? Let us investigate this point further.   Whoever received this knowledge needed to be capable of communicating it to others. It was not enough that this person was wise. Shri Krishna also needed a capable evangelist, one who had a mix of sattva and rajas, in order to both understand and spread this knowledge. A brahmana is predominantly saattvic by nature, and may not have been able to communicate and establish this knowledge in the world. Therefore Shri Krishna revealed this knowledge to Arjuna, the ultimate kshatriya warrior.   Moreover, Arjuna was Shri Krishna\u2019s devotee and friend. He had the best rapport with Shri Krishna, as well as profound reverence for him. So much so that Arjuna confided his fears to him in the first chapter, something that a kshatriya would hesitate to do. Arjuna also had the courage to ask any doubts without any fear of reprimand, and in doing so get a clear understanding of the teaching.   Many commentators believe that the 108 shlokas starting from shloka 11 of chapter 2 to this shloka comprise the entire message of the Gita. They say that Shri Krishna essentially completed the entire teaching and stopped speaking, having provided the paramparaa as the conclusion. The remainder of the Gita is an exposition of the teachings packed into these 108 shlokas. And it is Arjuna who helps us dig deeper into these teachings with his well-timed and thoughtful questions, like the one we will see in the next shloka."

He begins by stating that this knowledge has come from teacher to student. If we trace it back to its roots, we will find that the cosmic intelligence is the origin of this knowledge. This illustrates a beautiful aspect of the spiritual tradition: no one person claims authorship of knowledge. Even Tulsidas asserted that he did not write the Ramayana, but that it came from Lord Shiva.   When any teaching passes from generation to generation, the original message gets distorted. Shri Krishna says that even though this knowledge was prevalent in ancient times, is become distorted due to the long passage of time. Sant Jnyaneshwar in his commentary states that the distortion was further compounded by people becoming more materialistic and extroverted over the passage of time.   One example of distortion is musical raagaas. The raagas that we hear today are but a distorted version of the original raagas. Another example is that of rain water. When rain water falls from the sky, it is extremely pure like distilled water. But as it falls to the ground, it gets contaminated with pollutants in the air, dust and so on. We have to process that water in order to make it potable.   Therefore, now and then someone has to come to refresh the original message of the Gita, and that is what Shri Krishna is doing now. But he also needs to communicate it to the right person so that the message is properly understood. He addresses this point in the next shloka."

When any ancient texts are revealed, their tradition or heritage is also revealed. However, Shri Krishna first says that this teaching is imperishable. It always existed and can never be destroyed.   Shri Krishna then begins the paramparaa. He says that had revealed the same knowledge a long time ago to Vivasvaan. Vivasvaan means the sun. The name Vivasvaan is derived from the sanskrit root vasa meaning one who resides very well, or also, one who illumines everyone. The sun can be considered the first student of karmayoga. Not only does he selflessly provide light to the world, he also never gets tired doing so.   The sun then gave this knowledge to Manu. Manu is the original ancestor, and is considered to be the first human being from whom all humans originated, like Adam in the Bible. Hence humans are called manu-shya.   Manu then gave this knowledge to Ikshvaaku, who was the first king in the solar dynasty or the \u201csoorya-vansh\u201d. All these kings were kshatriyas or warriors. Shri Krishna highlights this point in order to make Arjuna, a warrior himself, better appreciate the teaching.   Now, Arjuna had a doubt. How could Shri Krishna, his best friend, have provided this knowledge to the sun? Arjuna will ask this question shortly. But first, Shri Krishna explained the need to resurrect this very ancient knowledge in the next shloka.   Footnotes   1. The symbolic interpretation of this shloka could be taken as follows: Vivasvaan is the light or the eternal essence that shines thought the intellect. Manu is the mind. Ikshvaaku is the senses.

        "content": "In chapter 2, Shri Krishna explained that the ultimate spiritual goal is the elimination of our vaasanaas. In chapter 3, he provides the technique of karmayoga which is the first step that all of us have to take in order to begin the process of elimination of vaasanaas.         First, he stressed the need to convince ourselves that we have to act. We simply cannot think that we can eliminate vaasanaas by not acting. Once we have convinced that we have to act, we have to adopt the attitude of karmayoga so that further actions do not cause bondage. The attitude of karmayoga comprises five aspects of knowledge or buddhi that we need to maintain while performing any action:        1. Samatva Buddhi : We need remain calm but alert in all situations. As the earlier chapter explained, situations are transient, they come and go. Having understood that they are transient, we should not get overly excited or agitated with each new situation.        2. Svadharma Buddhi : We should conduct self-analysis to understand where our strongest desires lie, and then deploy those desires in the service of a higher ideal.                 3. Samarpana Buddhi : We should always dedicate all our actions to something that is higher than us. We should remember that the entire universe is operating in a spirit of yajma. Whatever we own is material that is in the service of the yajna, it is not ours.        4. Asanga Buddhi : We should constantly assess whether we are attached to any material object, person, emotion, position or action. In other words, we should analyze our relationship with those things to understand whether we give so much importance to a thing that we cannot do without it. We should also remember that everything is the gunaas acting on the gunaas. Therefore, we should work with no expectation of the future, and no burden of the past.        5. Prasaada Buddhi : While we perform actions, we should not keep an eye on the result. We should accept every result as a \u201cprasaada\u201d. If we get attached to one type of result, whether it be positive or negative, the opposite or the complement of that result will torture us and bind us."

In these 2 shlokas, Shri Krishna gives Arjuna the seed of an entire lifetime\u2019s worth of spiritual practice. But this technique needs further elaboration, which will be provided in the forthcoming chapters of the Gita. Karmayoga is just the preparatory stage. The real journey of spiritual practice or saadhanaa commences only when we learn to control and channel our vaasanaas through karmayoga, which culminates in the practice of meditation.   One of the major points made in this shloka is that we have tackle our problems from the standpoint of the eternal essence, not from the standpoint of our prakriti, which is not our real identity. We have been conditioned to identify with our prakriti since our birth, which is what makes it difficult. Therefore, to the extent possible, we should always try to identify with the eternal essence.   For instance, we come across a thought that says \u201cI can smoke one cigarette today, it will cause me no harm\u201d, we have to be alert and ask ourselves, who is this I that has generated this thought? If we are truly identified with the eternal essence, we will recognize that our prakriti \u2013 our inbuilt tendency \u2013 is saying it. This is not easy to do. Typically, when such a thought arises, it \u201cshort-circuits\u201d our intellect and turns into action immediately. That is why Shri Krishna urges us to start on the path of karmayoga so that we slowly lose attachment with material objects first, then with our body/mind/intellect.   This inner conflict between our lower nature and our higher nature is the central theme of the Gita. Therefore, Shri Krishna concludes the chapter on karmayoga with a profound message: strengthen oneself by oneself. It means that by practicing karmayoga, we strengthen our higher nature, and that enables us to control our lower nature.   om tatsatiti shreematbhagavatgitasupanishadsu brahmavidyaayaam yogashaastre shreekrishnaarjunsamvade karmayogo naama tritiyodhyaayaha || 3 ||"

Let us examine its practical aspects.   This shloka provides us a hierarchy of our nature, or our prakriti. Earlier in the second chapter, Shri Krishna provided us with the ultimate goal of the Gita, which is to realize that we are the eternal essence, and are distinct from our prakriti, which comprises the body, mind and intellect. So in this shloka, he further informs us that these three components of our prakriti are not equally powerful \u2013 there is a hierarchy or an order to their power. The subtler a component is, the more power it wields.   The body is the most tangible, or the most gross, aspect of prakriti. Subtler than the body are the senses. Subtler than the senses is the mind, which generates reactions in the form of emotions and thoughts, but lacks decision making power. Subtler than the mind is the intellect, which can analyze and understand the thoughts generated by the mind, and has the power to control the mind, the senses and the body. And here is the key point: if we assert control of one aspect of prakriti, we automatically bring all the lower levels in our command.   For example, let\u2019s say someone wants to quit smoking. If he convinces his intellect that smoking is harmful, and also remains alert at the time a desire to smoke arises, he has a good chance of quitting smoking. But if the intellect starts rationalizing this behaviour by saying \u201cone cigarette is not a problem\u201d then there is no chance.   Now, if we are operating on the level of our vaasanaas, the intellect is where the hierarchy would stop. Then desires would take hold of the senses, the mind and even the intellect, making us act selfishly. There would be no way out. But this shloka urges us to realize that there is something even superior to the intellect, which has the potential to root our desires that have penetrated the intellect. In the initial stages of our journey, that something is a higher ideal. But as we proceed in our journey, it is the highest possible ideal: the eternal essence itself. Unless we recognize this, we will be stuck at the level of the intellect. This paves the way for the technique of removing obstacles, which is covered in the next and final shloka of the third chapter.   Footnotes   1. Bringing one\u2019s prakriti under control is one component of the \u201csaadhana-chatushtaya\u201d, or the four-fold qualifications of a seeker. Control of the senses is called \u201cdama\u201d and control of the mind is called \u201ckshama\u201d."

He advises Arjuna to first control desire at the level of the senses. Desires originate in the likes and dislikes present in the senses, and therefore, that is where we should go after them.   This requires us to be constantly aware and alert of our likes and dislikes, and not to get overpowered by them once we see them arise. For example, we can detect anger towards someone we dislike arise in our mind. We may try to suppress angry thoughts, but that is not feasible. Therefore we should first learn to control anger at level of the tongue by not speaking any harsh words towards that person.   How do we remain alert? There are several techniques to make us alert and bring us to the present moment. The simplest technique is to take a few breaths and just focus attention on the inhaling and exhaling. This will immediately stop all mental \u201cchatter\u201d.   Shri Krishna also mentions here that desire not only destroys knowledge but also wisdom. So let us correctly understand what is meant by wisdom here. Essentially, knowledge + experience = wisdom. If we read something in a book, then it is knowledge. But if we experience something on our own, then we own it and it becomes wisdom.   With this shloka, Shri Krishna answered the question raised by Arjuna, which was in regards to obstacles to karma yoga. He also provided a simple technique that only begins to address the obstacles, but does not completely eradicate them. In the next two verses, he concludes the topic of karmayoga by providing the advanced technique of removing these obstacles."

The enemy in the form of desire has three residences. The first residence is the senses, the second is the mind, and the third is the intellect. Note that he uses the term \u201cbody-dweller\u201d to remind us that the body, mind and intellect are separate than the eternal essence.   In the senses, desire and anger manifest as likes and dislikes, as we have seen before. Now, each sense organ has its own likes and dislikes. For example, the ear may find some sounds pleasing and others harsh. These likes and dislikes come from our natural tendencies or prakriti. You can see likes and dislikes in animals as well. Your pet dog may prefer one kind of food over another.   There is not much that we can do about our natural tendencies. We just need to ensure that they do not obstruct us from our goals. But when we feed them by giving them time and attention, they get charged by our emotions and take residence in our mind. Our mind is the faculty that gathers data from the senses and creates a coherent picture of what is being senses. It also generates thoughts based on current and past impressions.   Our language will give us an indication of whether a like is residing in our senses or in our mind. If we say, \u201cI like to eat fries\u201d or \u201cI prefer fries\u201d, it is still at the level of senses. But if we say, \u201cI absolutely love fries, I cannot do without them\u201d, it means that the like has now gone into the mind.   There is another indication that a desire has penetrated into the mind. A desire can be active even if the object of the desire is not perceived by the senses. If we dislike a person only when we meet him, then that dislike is at the level of the senses. But if we keep thinking \u201cI hate that person\u201d even when he is not in front of us, then that dislike has become hatred and has penetrated our mind.   The last and most dangerous place for a desire to reside is in our intellect, which is the faculty that takes decisions based on analysis and rationality. If we begin to justify and rationalize our loves and hates, it means that the desire has penetrated into our intellect. It is extremely difficult to tackle such desires, because they have completely taken hold of us: our senses, our mind and our intellect. Someone who resorts to violence and is utterly convinced of his position will even quote from scriptures to justify his actions, for instance.   So therefore, Shri Krishna provided Arjuna with the location and nature of the enemy that he needed to tackle. He explains the technique of tacking the enemy in the next shloka."

He says that desire is the \u201cthat\u201d by which \u201cthis\u201d wisdom is covered. If wisdom is covered, then prakriti takes control of us, and we fall into the depths of unintelligent behaviour.   Shri Krishna uses two metaphors to describe desire. First, he calls desire an eternal enemy. We may think that we have subdued desire, but its seed lies waiting in the form of likes and dislikes. When we least expect it, it will arise and turn into a strong desire within milliseconds. Hence, by calling it an eternal enemy, Shri Krishna urges us to be eternally alert and vigilant in regards to our desires.   The other metaphor used for desire is that of a fire. Fire never says no to any fuel that is added to it. It is capable of surviving indefinitely as long as fuel is provided. But conversely, it ends the minute it runs out of fuel. Therefore, Shri Krishna urges us to take our focus away from thoughts of like and dislike as soon as we are aware of them. It is the power behind thought that fuels likes and dislikes to stronger.   So therefore, having convinced Arjuna that desire and anger lie him and not within someone else, he proceeds to reveal their location to Arjuna in the next shloka. He purposely uses the language of war so that Arjuna will respond with rapt attention."

So what is the end result? Here, he says that when desire and hatred arise, they shut off or conceal our wisdom.   Our wisdom, or ability to discriminate, resides in our intellect. Due to a lifetime\u2019s worth of conditioning, this wisdom does not become our second nature. Wisdom is like a shining light, which can easily be covered if we are not careful. So desire, or anger, arise from the deeper, subconscious aspects of our mind and cover this light of wisdom. We then lose any ability to decide right from wrong, and behave foolishly. Shri Krishna says here that our wisdom can be covered in three ways.   The thickest, most dense covering occurs due to taamasic desires. These are desires that have lived inside our system for ages, and once they get activated, they totally cover the wisdom just like a womb covers a foetus. And just like there is no other way to see the foetus other than to wait for its birth, the only way to get rid of taamasic desires is to wait. They are so strong, and so in tune with our likes and dislikes, that nothing can be done once they are activated. Examples of taamasic desires are excessive drinking, drug usage, or even the overpowering desire to be \u201cright\u201d which can lead you into violent fights and arguments.   Less potent than taamasic desires are raajasic desires. As Shri Krishna says in this shloka, their veiling of wisdom is less thicker than taamasic desires. They are like dust on a mirror, where one stroke of the hand cleans the mirror. Raajasic desires are usually motivated by greed. Examples include buying the latest gadget, boasting of one\u2019s accomplishments to one\u2019s friends and so on.   Finally, saatvic desires are those that cover our wisdom very lightly. The desire to attend a satsang, or to attain moksha, is a saatvic desire. Our wisdom shines the brightest, or in other words, operates at the greatest capacity through saatvic desires.   As we progress in our journey, let us try to be alert and at least try to track the desires that we harbour. How many desires are we living with? What is the proportion between saatvic, raajasic and taamasic? Are we slowly changing the proportion in favour of saatvic desires?   In this shloka, the mysterious phrase \u201cthis covers that\u201d was used. Although we got a sense of what that means here, Shri Krishna goes into more detail in the next shloka."

They distract us from our path. But now, he uses the term \u201cenemy\u201d to refer to desire. What is the difference between a highway robber and an enemy? A highway robber does not care who we are, he just wants to distract us, rob us and let us go. But an enemy knows us, knows our weaknesses well, and intends to cause us great harm. Therefore, desire and anger are much more dangerous than likes and dislikes.   When we give a lot of attention to our likes and dislikes, it increases the proportion of the active quality, or rajas, in our system. When this happens, our likes and dislikes grow in size like weeds and become strong desires. We then go into a vicious cycle : strong desires create more rajas, which in turn makes the desires even stronger. Similarly, if dislikes grow, they turn into anger and hatred.   Now, when a strong desire gets fulfilled, there is a temporary pause in that desire, and the mind becomes still for a short amount of time. As we have seen earlier, an absence of desires clears the mind and lets the eternal essence shine through. When that happens, we experience peace and happiness. But, most of us wrongfully attribute that temporary spark of happiness to the object we just acquired, rather than to the absence of desire. So then, we go through life fueling our desires, in the hope that we can recreate that experience.   The tendency to recreate happiness through repetitive acquisition of an object is called greed. Moreover, the ego becomes strong through the increase in rajas, and it begins to go outward, comparing us with others. If someone has less than us, pride is created. Conversely, if someone has more than us, jealously is created.   The practical lesson here is that we should not encourage our likes and dislikes. In other words, if a like or dislike arises in the mind, we should not give it too much attention. If we do, it will get stronger. It is easier to control a like or a dislike. Once it has grown into a strong desire or hatred, then it becomes much difficult to control."

But Arjuna was not satisfied. He was listening attentively and wanted to know more details around the obstacles to karmayoga, how to spot them and how to get rid of them.   It is a wonderful question, because as we have seen earlier, obstacles to karmayoga pop up when we least expect them. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the obstacles is needed to fully overcome them. Note that Arjuna addresses Shri Krishna as \u201cvaarshneya\u201d, which means a member of the Vrishni dynasty.   Even in simple matters like our food intake, we face obstacles. Most of us are smart enough to know that foods containing a lot of oil and sugar are not good for us. But when we see our favourite dessert in front of us, we are propelled to eat it. All our intellect stops functioning. Well educated people, under the influence of greed, commit all kinds of scams today.   There is an interesting statement made by Duryodhana in the Mahaabhaarata. He says that even he knows that his actions are wrong, but there is something inside him that forces him to carry out those actions. This means that even a strong intellect is not necessarily able to check our behaviour.   In the final portion of the third chapter, Shri Krishna responds to Arjuna\u2019s doubt to describe the obstacles in detail and the method to control their influence on us."

Here, he seems to say that we should follow our nature instead. Let us try to analyze this paradox.   Earlier, we came across the notion of svadharma, which is work that one enjoys doing, has the aptitude and training for doing, and is not illegal or unethical. Svadharma is nothing but our strongest likes and desires, and only we can judge what they are.   Upon self-examination, we may find that we gravitate towards a career in art, or music, or science and so on. Let\u2019s say we determine that science is our strongest like. That now becomes our svadharma. We use the enormous pressure of our interest in science in the service of a higher goal, by becoming a researcher, for instance.   Another implication of this message is that the force generated by our svadharma should be used in evolution of our personality. A person with a strong desire to fight can become a soldier if he uses his svadharma in the service of his country. But he can also become a gangster if his svadharma is not dedicated to a higher ideal.   Therefore, what this shloka says is that once we have selected a strong desire as our svadharma, we should not let weaker likes or dislikes distract us from the svadharma. For example, let\u2019s say we are pursuing a PhD in science. We may come across someone following a different profession and who earns significantly more money. We should not cause our liking for more money to change our path. Not only will it help us reach our spiritual goal, we will have peace of mind too.   What is unique about this approach is that it emphasizes introspection over blind faith. The beauty of the Gita\u2019s teaching is that takes care of every person. There is no fixed rigid path \u2013 each one arrives at their own path through self-analysis. It is like a kitchen where each spice is unique, but has a distinct role to play in making a meal."

He says that the tendencies manifest as likes and dislikes for material objects. These tendencies reside in our senses: the eyes, ears, skin, tongue and nose.   First let\u2019s look at likes and dislikes. The only way we can truly understand the shape of our inherent tendencies is through a deep examination of our likes and dislikes. Every human being harbours likes and dislikes. It is so strange that two children having grown up in the exact same home and family environment reveal such different likes and dislikes, even as toddlers.   So where are the likes and dislikes stored? They reside in our sense organs. The tongue is attracted to the taste of fries, and is repelled by the taste of spinach. The eye likes a certain kind of form and is repelled by another and so on. In his commentary on the Gita, Sant Jnyaneshwar compares the sense organs to dangerous animals and asks : does one befriend a snake, or maintain the company of tigers?   So therefore, what is the solution? We should not come under the sway of likes and dislikes by being aware of them especially when they strike, by using our intellect to guide us, and by continually reminding ourself of the higher ideal we have set for ourselves in karmayoga. We should not let them create a roadblock in our path. Like an elephant that moves on its path even though dogs bark at it, we should keep likes and dislikes at bay and never lose sight of our path and goal.   The first chapter of the Gita provides the best example for this shloka. Arjuna loved warfare, but he did not like the Mahabhaarata war simply because his relatives were on the other side. Shri Krishna, representing the intellect, guided him towards the right path. Another example is when a doctor prescribes us bitter medicine \u2013 we may not like but we take it nevertheless.   Shri Krishna compares likes and dislikes to highway robbers who target travellers that are unprepared and not alert. The robbers will come out of nowhere, and distract travellers from their path. Similarly, the likes make us run towards them and dislikes make us run away, but ultimately both take us away from our path. By being constantly alert that likes and dislikes can arise, we can reduce their influence."

Why is this so? It is because inbuilt tendencies and urges inside us compel us to act against our will. These tendencies comprise our lower nature. Note that the lower nature is also called \u201cprakriti\u201d here, which is different than the prakriti that we saw earlier.   All beings \u2013 plants, animals and humans \u2013 are born with an innate set of traits. In humans, these traits are manifested in the body, mind and intellect. These traits are a product of our vaasanaas, which are impressions created by past actions.   It does not matter whether one is wise or foolish, rich or poor etc. All human beings are born with vaasanaas. These vaasanaas are \u201cthought generators\u201d. They cause thoughts about the material world to arise in our mind. And once a thought arises, it results into desire and action as we saw in the second chapter.   Therefore, Shri Krishna says that mere restraint of actions will not result in eradication of desires, since the vaasanaas will continue to generate more and more thoughts. And direct suppression of thoughts is next to impossible. Many people try to repress thoughts and desires in the hope of progressing spiritually, but like a spring that is pushed down, that strategy backfires very easily.   But then, should we give up our efforts altogether? That is not the case. For example, you cannot teach tiger to be non-violent and eat grass. But you can change his behaviour to a certain extent through repeated training. Similarly, the vaasanaas can be channeled in the service of society. Like judo uses the opponent\u2019s strength to subdue the opponent, karmayoga uses the energy of vaasanaas to extinguish themselves.   So therefore, Shri Krishna gives us a way out. Even though all of us have tendencies that can drag us lower, we can analyze those tendencies and overcome them through the technique of karmayoga. Having explained this, Shri Krishna gives us the exact location of our enemies, these lower tendencies, in the next shloka."

But even if we overcome our philosophical objections, most of us will still find it difficult to follow the practice of karmayoga. Shri Krishna therefore begins to explain what prevents us from adopting karmayoga, and consequently, how should we tackle those obstacles.   The primary obstacle to karmayoga are our vaasanaas. Once a person is under the influence of vaasanaas, their actions will be prompted by selfish motives. These motives are expressed as negative emotions such as jealousy: \u201cI will do things to make others jealous\u201d, or out of anger: \u201cI will destroy this person\u201d, or greed: \u201cI will earn so much even if it means I compromise on ethics\u201d. Some people even pass on negative motives to their children, e.g. \u201cI was not able to destroy this family, so you go ahead and do it, my son\u201d.   Now, when we dwell in negative emotions such as jealousy, anger, greed etc., our intellect knows that what we are doing is wrong. But since our vaasanaas have overpowered the intellect, it does not function and so we follow a wrong path. We are then ruined because we are going against the laws of nature. What would happen if we disregarded the law of gravity? We would perish. A similar fate exists if we do not pursue karmayoga.   So the question is : how exactly do vaasanaas cause us not follow karmayoga? Shri Krishna covers this topic next."

Prior to the Gita coming into existence, people heralded a misconception that spiritual realization was the domain of a select section of society, and could be achieved only through the accomplishment of extremely secret and arcane rituals. The Gita proposed a radical new method of realization where anyone regardless of their background can get the same result while performing any and all actions.   So therefore, Shri Krishna urges us to overcome any misconceptions, barriers and objections we may harbour against this teaching. Some may say, this teaching is too simplistic. Others may say, it goes against whatever preconceived notions they have about religion. Or that it is not achievable and so on. Whatever be the objection, Shri Krishna wants us to put the teaching into practice and try it out for ourselves.   Now, as he is about to conclude the teaching of karmayoga, Shri Krishna anticipates a problem. He knows that even for people who are ready and willing to take this path will run into obstacles. He covers this topic in the next shloka."

It can be considered \u201ckarmayoga in a nutshell\u201d. In this shloka, he covers the following 3 topics:   1. What should be our attitude while performing actions?   2. What kinds of actions should we perform?   3. How do we make our actions more efficient?   First, he talks about the attitude that one should maintain while performing actions. He says that before, during and after the action, one should continuously dedicate the action to a higher ideal. It can be any higher ideal like our family, employer or nation, but we should consider it pure and divine, indicated by the word \u201cme\u201d in the shloka.   What is important here is never get out of tune with the higher ideal \u2013 it is like talking to a friend constantly on a handsfree telephone while performing all actions. We can use the ritual of a \u201cpooja\u201d to practice this act of dedication, but the key is to do it constantly, not just during the pooja. Furthermore, we will know whether the action was in service of a higher ideal or of our ego by the feeling we get once the action is complete. If we find that we have a deep sense of peace and contentment after the action was performed, it was in the service of a higher ideal.   Secondly, he asks us to use our intellect to guide us so that only correct actions, those that are our duties, are performed by us. Actions that are unethical or illegal should be discarded by the intellect. He urges us to strengthen and reinforce the intellect\u2019s power of discrimination, or viveka.   Finally, Shri Krishna gives us a formula to make actions extremely efficient. He explains that our mental energy and focus \u201cleaks\u201d out of our system through three sources: brooding over the past, becoming anxious about the future, and becoming overly excited in the present. How does this leakage happen?   \u201cAashaa\u201d or harbouring expectations is akin to living in the future because it gives rise to anxiety. It is as if we are insulting the present moment. \u201cMamatva\u201d or my-ness implies that we are giving undue importance to our past achievements. In other words, we are living in the past. No matter what happened in the past usually gives rise to sorrow if we brood over it. And \u201cjvarah\u201d or extreme excitement and agitation in the present has the effect of destabilizing our mind and intellect.   All of these three tendencies ultimately take attention away from the present moment, strengthen our ego and diminish our efficiency. So therefore, a true karmayogi always lives in the present moment and gives complete and undivided attention to the task at hand, no matter what kind of task it is. Shri Krishna urges us to give up expectation for the future (\u201cniraasha\u201d), anxiety over the past (\u201cnirmamah\u201d) and overexcitement in the present (\u201cvigatajvarah\u201d).   Footnotes   1. Eckhart Tolle has written an entire book on the topic of acting in the present moment called \u201cThe Power Of Now\u201d."

It is nothing but their degree of attachment to gunaas (forces of nature) and their actions. He also restates that wise people should not preach karmayoga to those who are attached to gunaas and their actions. Instead, they should lead by example.   Why should they do so? The teacher in a school does not condemn or ridicule a student\u2019s ignorance about mathematics. He fully well knows that the student is in very early stages of his curriculum. With enough time and practice, the student will evolve into a higher level of math understanding.   Similarly, a wise person does not condemn or judge anyone, knowing that everyone is at a different level of spiritual evolution. \u201cJudge not, that ye be not judged\u201d as the Bible says in Matthew 7.1.   As a point of clarification, let us reexamine the message of the last 2 shlokas, which was that most of us mistakenly think that the \u201cI\u201d is the doer. We had seen that it is a tough statement to swallow, so let\u2019s look at a common question that arises when one hears this statement. \u201cI am a well renowned surgeon. I just completed a successful triple-bypass surgery. So if I did not do it, who did?\u201d   There was a team of three \u201cagents\u201d that performed the operation \u2013 the surgeon\u2019s mind, body and intellect. The mind gathered data from the five senses and presented it to the intellect. The intellect, based on past experiences and knowledge, took decisions. These decisions were sent to the surgeon\u2019s body, specifically the fingers, which performed the operation.   The real \u201cI\u201d, which is the eternal essence, was a witness of this entire surgery. But the principle of the ego or ahamkaara created a mix-up between the real-I and the three agents: mind, body and intellect. Reversing this fundamental mix-up is the ultimate goal of karmayoga, in fact, of any yoga."

Having known this, he does not get attached.   tattvavit : knower of truth   tu : but   mahaabaaho : O mighty-armed   gunaa : gunas   karma : functions   vibhaagayoh : distinction   gunaa : gunas   guneshu : in gunas   vartanta : act   iti : this   matvaa : having known   na : does not   sajjate : get attached   Previously, we learned about the ignorant individual who is deluded by the notion that he is the doer. But then, what does the wise person know that the ignorant one does not? Shri Krishna explains that point here.   The wise person is termed a \u201ctattva-vit\u201d \u2013 one who knows the truth \u2013 by Shri Krishna. The truth, as we saw earlier, is that all actions in this world are performed by prakiriti. And prakriti is comprised of the three gunaas and their respective functions, termed in this shloka as \u201cguna-karma-vibhaaga\u201d. But how exactly do we know that prakriti causes the actions, not the \u201cI\u201d?   Our sense organs are like agents that send messages to the mind when they perceive an object. For instance, if you hold a rose in your hand, the eyes, skin and nose send different signals to the mind. The mind creates a holistic picture from all those signals \u2013 \u201cthis is a red rose\u201d \u2013 and sends it to the intellect. The intellect analyzes that information and makes a decision \u2013 \u201cbuy this rose\u201d, having consulted its memory of past experiences with roses.   This means that perception, thinking, decision-making \u2013 all these functions are part of prakriti, operating based on laws set by prakriti. The \u201cI\u201d is the eternal essence, different from prakriti.   So therefore, if one knows that he is not the doer, and that things are happening of their own accord, he does not get attached to anything in this world. He becomes a witness or a \u201csaakshi\u201d, just like someone watching a play does not get attached to one actor or another. Another example is the process of digestion. We are not attached to it because we know that we are not the doer in that instance. The notion that everything is an interplay of gunaas may seem abstract and theoretical. One can only gain a first-hand experience of this truth in deep stages of meditation.   This teaching is beneficial in our day-to-day lives as well. If we contemplate on this teaching, it has the effect of thinning our ego. Once that happens, it makes us very humble and reduces several negative emotions like fear, anger, stress and so on. Now, we may fear that this teaching makes us lackadaisical. On the contrary, it makes thinking clear and actions more efficient by getting rid of negative emotions that drain our mental energy."

        "content": "prakruteh kriyamaanaani gunaih karmaani sarvashah |   ahamkaaravimoodhaatmaa kartaahamiti manyate || 27 ||   All actions, in all situations, are performed by the gunaas of prakriti.

But what exactly does it mean to be attached to action? Shri Krishna clarifies that point in this shloka, which is yet another deep shloka with layers and layers of meaning. We shall approach it step by step to grasp its essentials.   First, let us take the example of someone who has accomplished a great thing, for example, won a Grammy award for outstanding singing. If that singer truly examines her accomplishment, she will realize that there were so many people and situations that were responsible for her accomplishment.   To begin with, her parents probably encouraged her to pursue music seriously. Her music teacher taught her the theoretical aspects of music. She met other musicians who helped hone her craft. She came across a situation that inspired her to write her award-winning song. Her accomplishment was a product of all these factors.   Compare that singer to some other award-winning singer who thinks that it was he who did it all, and does not even acknowledge the contribution of others. The notion that \u201cI am the doer\u201d is called \u201cahamkaara\u201d or the ego, and creates an \u201cus-vs-them\u201d attitude. Someone who is under the influence of the ego is called deluded in this shloka.   Let us now look at what is meant by gunaas and prakriti so that we can better understand the shloka. Just like our scientists have discovered that all of matter is made up of fundamental particles known as atoms, ancient rishis postulated that all matter or prakriti is made up of combinations of three essential forces: an inert force, an active force, and a harmonizing force. These three forces or gunas are known as tamoguna, rajoguna and sattvaguna respectively.   Now here comes a statement which is a little difficult to swallow. Like the singer whose accomplishments had very little to do with her \u201cown\u201d efforts, every action that we perform is in reality performed by prakriti that is comprised of the gunas.   So then who are \u201cwe\u201d? We go back to the second chapter to remember that we are the eternal essence that is everlasting and all-pervading. Like the sun that enlivens the earth but does not itself do anything, the eternal essence does not perform any action. It only enlivens prakriti which is performing the action. Most of us that do not realize this truth, unfortunately, fall in the \u201cignorant\u201d category. The next shloka shows us the goal : how to become wiser.   Footnotes   1. Prakriti is further subdivided into the following 24 components:   \u2013 5 elements : space, air, fire, water, earth   \u2013 5 mediums : sound, touch, form, taste, smell   \u2013 5 sense organs : ear, skin, eye, tongue, nose   \u2013 5 organs of actions : speech, grasp, movement, generation, excretion   \u2013 4 internal organs : mind, intellect, memory, ego   2. Prakriti is also known as Maya"

In this shloka, Shri Krishna provides the reason behind that statement. We shall first look at an example in this regard.   Consider a car going at a fast speed on a major highway. Other cars on the highway are going equally as fast. The car contains a driver and one passenger who have divided the responsibilities equally : the driver is in charge of driving, and the passenger is in charge of navigation and directions. The passenger keeps the driver informed of where to turn, how much time is left before the next food break and so on.   Now in the middle of the journey, the passenger realizes that they are on the wrong highway. What is the best course of action for the passenger? If he says to the driver \u201cStop! We have to turn back!\u201d it could unsettle the driver and potentially cause a major accident on the highway. Instead he choses to gently inform the driver to take the next exit, stop for a few minutes in a safe area, and then figure out how to get back on the proper highway.   Similarly, when working with other people, the practitioner of karmayoga should continue to perform actions diligently instead of preaching to others about karmayoga, in other words, change their way of doing action. There will always be a tendency to misinterpret the message of karmayoga if we begin preaching it to others. As evidence, note that even Arjuna had incorrectly assumed that one should give up actions altogether.   Therefore, this shloka advises us to act diligently, and let others act to the best of their ability, and not to unsettle them in any way."

He says that one who is working with the attitude of karmayoga should learn to work in harmony with others who may have not yet understood or learned that technique. In other words, Shri Krishna warns us from adopting a \u201cholier-than-thou\u201d attitude with others when performing action.   For instance, imagine a little girl playing by herself, and pretending to make tea in a small cup. She brings an empty cup to her aunt and asks her to drink that tea. The aunt should enjoy that fake tea, not start questioning the reality of that team. There is no need to do so, the child is doing what is appropriate. Similarly, just because one is studying karmayoga does not make him or her eligible to behave differently with others.   Now, most of our actions are either performed individually or in a team. If we are performing actions individually, it is very straightforward to adopt the attitude of karmayoga. If we are working in a team, we could be playing the role of peers, leaders or followers. In all three of these situations, Shri Krishna urges us to maintain the attitude of karmayoga regardless of whether our peers, leaders or followers have the very same attitude. Their attitude in no way should impact the efficiency of our work.   This \u201clive and let live\u201d approach is extremely practical and sensible. But is there a reason behind it? Shri Krishna will explain in the next verse."

As someone who is has realized the eternal essence, he does not have any obligations towards the world. But even then, he continues to act towards the welfare of society. Here, he says that if he stopped acting, all people who look up to him would be ruined and destroyed. We saw the example of a great social activist like Baba Amte, who although having performed such selfless service, continued to act till his last day. Society would take a huge hit if someone like him abruptly stopped working.   In addition, there is a subtler meaning here. Shri Krishna\u2019s statements have a cosmic significance. So therefore, the word \u201cI\u201d also refers to every law or principle that works every second of our lives and never ever takes a vacation.   For instance, we all know what happens to a society when there is a breakdown of law and order. There will be chaos, confusion and destruction all around. But civil and criminal laws are just man-made laws. Consider what would happen if the law of gravity, a universal law, stopped working. People, buildings, and every free standing object on this earth would start flying out into space to its eventual destruction. And finally, what if our breathing or pumping of the heart stopped working?   Therefore the message to Arjuna is clear. Any task, no matter how insignificant or unpleasant, should be performed selflessly and with dexterity, if it is in the service of the higher good."

In his early years, he acted as a defense lawyer for freedom fighters imprisoned by British authorities in the 1942 Quit India movement. Later, Amte founded three ashrams for treatment and rehabilitation of leprosy patients, disabled people, and people from marginalized sections of the society in India. Today, the largest ashram named Anandwan has a university, an orphanage, and schools for the blind and the deaf, housing over 5,000 residents.

People would start saying \u201cIf even Baba Amte does not work, why should I do so?\u201d   Therefore, Shri Krishna urged Arjuna to always perform action and not give in to the tendency of the human body to become lazy. If not for Arjuna\u2019s own sake, at least for the sake of others who considered him as a role model. And similarly, he urges us also to become role models by continually performing selfless actions, with complete attention and alertness."

Having given the example of king Janaka, Shri Krishna now spoke about himself as an example of an ideal karma yogi. He had attained a state of supreme independence where he no longer needed to act, yet, he continued to act spontaneously and joyfully in the service of humanity.   The Srimad Bhaagvatam is filled with stories describing the life of Shri Krishna, where we find that he worked tirelessly from the start to the end of his life. There was no duty that he did not perform. He became a charioteer upon Arjuna\u2019s request. After the Mahabhaarata war, Arjuna\u2019s brother Yudhishthira performed a yajna. There, Shri Krishna even washed the feet of guests who attended. While performing any action, his attitude was that of equanimity, and he found great joy in the work while not expecting any reward.   Shri Krishna\u2019s attitude towards life was like that of a perfect actor in a play. In fact, his stories are also known as \u201cleelas\u201d or divine plays. An actor in a play will perform any role \u2013 big or small \u2013 without the slightest attachment to it, and move to the next role effortlessly. Whether it was a mischievous boy who stole butter from people\u2019s homes, or the ruler of Dwarakaa city, Shri Krishna played his part perfectly with the attitude of a karma yogi."

Here Shri Krishna puts forth yet another argument to Arjuna, knowing very well that Arjuna always put others first before himself. Shri Krishna said that whosoever looked up to Arjuna as a role model would also take to this path if Arjuna followed it.   Now, an extremely important but subtle point made by Shri Krishna is hidden in the phrase \u201cideal person does\u201d. He wants us to realize that actions speak louder than words. For instance, we cannot expect our children to not drink alcohol or smoke if we preach to them, but drink and smoke ourselves. Not just children, but most people watch what we do and not what we say. Therefore, Shri Krishna urges us to practice karmayoga, and not to simply tell people that we are learning it and so on.   So in addition to urging us and Arjuna to perform karmayoga, Shri Krishna also reveals an important leadership lesson. The best way to lead is to lead by example, and not by making flowery speeches or hiring motivational speakers. This point is not just echoed in the management texts of today, but also in spiritual masterpieces such as the Dasbodh by Samarth Ramdas Swami."

He wanted to demonstrate that it indeed was the right path to follow. Providing an example would also eliminate any doubt in Arjuna\u2019s mind that karmayoga was a proven methodology, not a new invention.   The first example that Shri Krishna provided was that of king Janaka, an apt example since he was a warrior just like Arjuna. Many of us familiar with the Ramayana epic would recognize the name Janaka as the father of Sita, and the king of the Videha kingdom. But the word Janaka here is a post or a title. It refers to any king that was appointed to the throne because of his non-attachment to all material objects, even to his body. This is apparent in the word meaning of Videha which is \u201cone who has given up identification with his body\u201d.   Why would a kingdom appoint a king that has given up attachments? It is because someone without any attachment would make the most fair, rational and unbiased decisions in favour of the kingdom. He would not come under the sway of emotion or prejudice of any kind. Such kings were known to be excellent administrators. In addition, they were also perfect karmayogis, i.e. they were \u201csthitha-prajna\u201d or men of perfect wisdom.   With this example, Shri Krishna also assured Arjuna that it was perfectly possible to attain the ultimate goal of realization, yet be working in this world.

Arjuna had asked Shri Krishna as to why he should commit the act of war, which in his opinion was a ghastly act. Let us recap Shri Krishna\u2019s answer.   Shri Krishna replied by explaining that no one can flee from action, that one should perform selfless rather than selfish actions, that selfless actions in the service of a higher ideal do not create bondage, and that performance of selfless action or yajna is the key to participating in the evolution of oneself and of the universe.   Another point emphasized in this shloka is that karmayoga should not be something that is restricted to only a few aspects of life. The karmayoga mindset should eventually become second nature, in other words, it should be embedded in each and every action that we perform. So therefore, in each and every action that we perform, from writing an email to eating our meals, we should remember to derive joy from the action itself rather than in the result. Only then will we begin to drop attachment to the action and to the result."

In other words, all his actions become selfless and spontaneous, like an artist who cares only about creating paintings without any expectation (art for art\u2019s sake).   Shri Krishna further elaborates that point in this shloka. He says that for such a person, the concept of gain or loss does not exist, nor does the notion of dependency or support from anyone or anything.   To better understand this shloka, let us imagine a situation where one is at the end of a critical chapter in one\u2019s life, e.g. imagine that a person has submitted his resignation and is in the last week of his job. What will be his mindset? He will suddenly become the nicest guy in the office, and the most fun guy to hang out with. Why is that? Everyone knows that he has no agenda with anyone anymore, since it does not really matter. And he can surf the web all day long, because it does not really matter whether he works or doesn\u2019t work.   Another example could be a person who at age 65 has just retired. He has made a decent fortune with his savings, and can live comfortably till his last day. In addition, he is quite healthy and can still work if needed. But just like in the earlier example, it does not matter whether he performs any action or doesn\u2019t. Moreover, since he does not have any dependency on anyone, his savings make him self sufficient. Therefore, for the individual that has realized the worth of the eternal essence \u201ctreasure\u201d, any other material gain or loss does not hold any meaning.   Ultimately, these 2 shlokas reveal the state of a realized person, who by losing all sense of doership, renounces all action. Renouncing doership is renouncing action. The topic of renunciation is covered in detail in the forthcoming chapters."

In other words, are there any circumstances where do not need to perform actions anymore? Shri Krishna gives the answer in this shloka and the next.   If we examine ourselves, we realize that we derive pleasure and satisfaction from external sources: material objects, people, relationships and so on. Pleasant memories, which can be considered internal to us, do give us joy but were generated from some external source in the past. But, in reality, the source of happiness is the absence of desires experienced when we finally attain a material object.   For instance, if we want to buy a new shirt, a desire is created in the mind. Till such time that we get the shirt, we will be unhappy because of that desire. But once the desire is fulfilled, we experience happiness for a brief period of time. Is that happiness caused by the shirt, or by the temporary absence of desires? The wise person knows that it is the latter.   So in this shloka Shri Krishna makes a bold statement. He says that till we derive pleasure and satisfaction from things external to us, we have to act in this world. Conversely, one who no longer derives pleasure and satisfaction from external sources does not need to act in this world. He \u201crevels\u201d in the eternal essence which he has learned to recognize within himself. He no longer has to look outside for happiness.   Is there a contradiction here? Earlier it was mentioned that if one is human, one has to act. But here, it is mentioned that the realized individual does not need to act? The answer is that once that individual has understood the true source of happiness, he loses the sense of doership. In other words, the notion that \u201cI am doing this action\u201d goes away, and all his actions become natural and spontaneous.   As an example, if you truly love painting, and have mastered all the skills, then your painting becomes effortless and spontaneous. You experience a feeling that some people call \u201cbeing in the zone\u201d. In fact, there may come a stage where you will feel that the hand is moving by itself, and the painting is happening on its own.   Similarly, all the actions of this wise individual become like that spontaneous painting."

Which means, it is a method to move from a lower plane of existence to a higher plane of existence.   Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution describes how life evolved from simple single-celled organisms into plants, then into animals, then into primates, and culminated in our species, the humans. What comes next? Shri Krishna explains that humans, being the only species capable of rational analysis and thinking, have a choice: to remain at the current state and give in to their \u201clower nature\u201d, or evolve into a higher state of existence.   What is the \u201clower nature\u201d? When one continually harbours selfish desires, and lives for the sake of sense pleasure, that person generates guilt, fear, anger, hatred, pride and other such emotions that strengthen the ego. Such an individual is termed \u201cmalicious\u201d by Shri Krishna. That individual is said to have lived in vain, because he did not use the wonderful opportunity of being born as a human to access the higher nature.   And so, who is the individual of \u201chigher nature\u201d? It is the individual who has begun identifying with a higher ideal, and in doing so, has slowly eroded his ego in the selfless service of that higher ideal. A detailed description of such an individual was provided by Shri Krishna in the latter part of the second chapter in the \u201csthita-prajna-lakshana\u201d or the signs of a wise individual. Karmayoga is the first step to participate in this system of evolution."

Here he says that yajna is an integral part of the eternal essence, because it is born out of the Vedas. Symbolically, the Vedas represent the \u201crule-book\u201d of the universe, and so yajna becomes an essential law embedded in the universe.   In the second chapter, which was an overview of the entire Gita, Shri Krishna pointed Arjuna to the ultimate goal of life \u2013 realization of the eternal essence. In this chapter, Shri Krishna connect karmayoga to the eternal essence. He explains that karmayoga is a means, a technique, to realize the eternal essence, because the eternal essence created the rules of the universe.   So in summary, the teaching of karmayoga so far is : Actions are of two types,         selfless and selfish. Selfish actions bind us to wordly objects, and selfless actions do not. Therefore, Shri Krishna urges us to move gradually from the level of inaction to selfish action first, and then from selfish action to selfless action or yajna. Only through acting in the spirit of yajna will we move forward on the path to realizing the eternal essence."

If we interpret this shloka literally, it refers to Vedic rituals that were used to invoke the rain-gods. But if we want to go deeper, we have to interpret this shloka symbolically.   We have seen that action is an integral tendency of any object in the universe. Even a tiny atom is always acting. So when any group of organisms \u2013 plants, animals, humans \u2013 collectively work for the sake of a higher ideal, that is called yajna. The output of this yajna is an environment that is charged with the potential to create almost anything. This environment is symbolically called \u201crain\u201d in this shloka. Finally, this rain or productive potential creates all kinds of objects that are useful to organisms. The shloka refers to these objects as \u201cfood\u201d.   For instance, take a largely unknown area in northern California during World War II. Many scientists, lawyers, professors, business people came to this area with a higher ideal : to further the frontier of technology. Through their collective efforts, they created an environment which became conducive to technological innovation, which we now know as silicon valley. And silicon valley, even to this day, produces cutting edge products that benefit people around the world.   There are several such examples of environments born out of yajna: India\u2019s freedom struggle, the economic success of Singapore, the entertainment industry in Bombay and so on.   So the message here is that if people come together to work towards a higher ideal, it is a guarantee that their efforts will be successful."

We saw that in the first level, the individual does not perform any action and only consumes. In this shloka, Shri Krishna explains the second and third levels of action.   Selfish action is the second level of action. In this level, the individual only thinks about himself. His vision is very narrow and limited. When this individual works in a team, his only thought is : how much of the result can be kept for myself? He also treats everyone he works with as his competitors. For him to win, they have to lose. Shri Krishna says that such individuals \u201ccook only for themselves\u201d and \u201cconsume only sin\u201d.   The third level and highest level of action is that of selfless action. The individual who works selflessly seldom thinks about himself. His vision is broad : he is always thinking about how to act such that his family will benefit, his employer will benefit, his nation will benefit and so on. He always treats others with respect, and as partners in collectively achieving the highest possible goal. Shri Krishna says that by working in this highest level of action, such \u201cwise individuals\u201d are \u201cliberated from all sins\u201d.   Another mark of this individual that he treats everything that he possesses as materials to be used in a yajna. Which means that he does not consider anything as \u201cmine\u201d \u2013 everything belongs to the higher ideal (family, company, nation etc). So therefore, he is more than happy to partake in what\u2019s left after everyone else has consumed their share of the fruits of the yagna. Our natural tendency is to make a grab for our share and then let others worry about theirs. But this individual, keeping sight of the higher ideal at all times, ensures that others are taken care of before taking care of himself.   So what does this mean for us? When we perform any action every day, let us make an attempt to gauge the level of the action being performed by us. Is it selfish? selfless? or are we so lazy that we are not acting at all?"

He also emphasized the notion of yajna or selfless dedication. Now Shri Krishna gives three levels of action that a person can operate under.   In this shloka, Shri Krishna points out the lowest level of action. This is when an individual consumes objects without making any contribution whatsoever. Shri Krishna uses a strong word to describe such an individual : a \u201cthief\u201d. Such a selfish person does not care about anyone but himself due to his large ego.   An obvious example is someone who is part of a project team. He does not do any work in team but claims all the credit. In today\u2019s language we would call such a person a freeloader. Such people are never held in good standing by anyone.   In traditions all over the world, we see evidence that we are encouraged to give back something each time we take something. In Indian culture, it is customary that before one eats a meal, one offers it to the less fortunate, the wise and learned, and to animals. In most cultures, when you cut down a tree, you are encouraged to plant few more. Even in the corporate world, when a company earns profits, it invests a portion back into the business before handing out the dividends.   Therefore, taking without giving back is the lowest level of action. The next shloka illustrates the two higher levels of action. We need to gauge which level we belong to, so that we can start moving to the highest level of selflessness."

Modern management practices agree that when two parties negotiate, the best outcome is one where both parties benefit, rather than one gaining and one losing. This outcome is known as a \u201cwin-win\u201d situation. Shri Krishna reinforces this very same principle. He urges us to act in a spirit of harmony and cooperation with others whenever we undertake any action.   An interesting word is used here : \u201cdevataa\u201d or deity. What does it represent? It represents each and every factor that is responsible for our action. In a narrow sense, it represents other individuals who collectively represent the higher ideal that we are working for, e.g. members in our family, colleagues in our company, citizens in our nation and so on.   But in a broad sense, it includes all humans, animals, plants and all of nature that we share this earth with. It is a recognition that there is a higher ideal operating at all times when we perform even a trivial action like eating our lunch. Shri Krishna urges us to not forget this point.   In essence, if we serve a higher ideal, that higher ideal will serve us. This is the message.

However, how do I know that I will be able to fulfill my material needs if I give up caring for the fruits of action altogether?\u201d Shri Krishna has the answer : perform actions with selfless dedication or yajna, and your material needs will be provided for automatically.   If we work for a corporation, we do several different things everyday to fulfill our job responsibilities: respond to emails, attend meetings, draft project plans, make excel documents and so on. Do we ever think : \u201chow much money will I get paid for opening this email? how much money do I get for attending this meeting?\u201d If we have done our job right, the results will automatically come to us in the form of a monthly salary.

With this shloka, he begins the main topic of this chapter, which deals with how to perform actions. The second chapter mentioned it briefly, but this chapter goes deeper into it.   Shri Krishna uses the beautiful metaphor of a \u201cyajna\u201d to convey this teaching. In Indian culture, a yajna is a formal ritual of worship. Firstly, we fix a higher ideal before commencing a yajna, and dedicate the entire yajna to that ideal. Typically, that ideal is a \u201cdevataa\u201d or a deity. Secondly, we perform actions such as chanting mantras and pouring oblations into the sacrificial fire, but do so with absolutely no trace of selfishness. Some mantras even include the words \u201cnaa mama\u201d or \u201cnot me\u201d to make unselfishness explicit.   So how does that ancient ritual apply to us? Let\u2019s look at a practical example. An accountant working for a corporation can be successful if she acts in the spirit of a yajna. She should set a higher ideal, e.g. \u201cI dedicate myself to the success of this corporation\u201d. Then, she should perform her job responsibilities in the service of that goal. She will, for instance, frequently sign large cheques where there are opportunities to play games for selfish profit. But she will not even think about such things because her focus is on the company\u2019s well being, not hers.   Now let\u2019s see what happens when her goal becomes becomes selfish. She will begin to do things that generate \u201cconflict of interest\u201d in corporate-speak. She may slowly divert some of the company money to a shell company owned by a friend and so on. From a wordly perspective, she will get kicked out of the company sooner or later. From a spiritual perspective, each selfish action will bind her, propelling her into further selfish desires, and away from self-realization."

He urges Arjuna to only perform \u201cniyatam\u201d or prescribed actions. What does this term mean?   Scriptures classify actions into several categories. Let us look at the two main ones: \u201cniyatam\u201d or prescribed actions, and \u201cnishiddha\u201d or forbidden actions . Prescribed actions are those that are enjoined in the Vedas. But in today\u2019s context, we can interpret this as one\u2019s duties. These include performing one\u2019s svadharma, serving one\u2019s parents, family, and nation etc. Forbidden actions are the \u201cthou shalt not\u201d actions such as killing another being, stealing, cheating and so on. So here, Shri Krishna urges Arjuna to perform prescribed actions, but without any trace of attachment to the action or to the fruit.   Now one may say \u201cI like to watch a movie and enjoy a good meal. Those do not seem like prescribed duties. How should we think about those?\u201d. Shri Krishna does not advocate repressing anything, as we saw earlier. But we should to define boundaries to any action, as well as minimize attachment or selfish motive. The best way to do so is to share.   If you want to watch TV, watch it collectively with your family and friends. Or share your meal with them. Doing so will ensure that our previously self-serving actions lose any trace of selfishness or ego. The best example here is a mom that always cooks what the family members like, and puts her preferences on a lower priority.   In addition, Shri Krishna reiterates the notion that one should never resort to inaction, He says that if one does not act, one cannot even perform maintenance of one\u2019s body.   Our body is an important tool in our spiritual journey. Nowhere in the Gita has Shri Krishna asked us to neglect it. In fact, here he is saying that one should absolutely perform action to maintain the body, including bathing it, feeding it, keeping it strong and fit, and going to the doctor if it is not working properly. It is an extremely practical teaching."

A different approach is needed to clean our vasanaas and selfish desires. In this shloka, Shri Krishna says that we should not give up actions \u2013 instead, we should give up attachment.   Giving up attachment is a technique unto itself, and this chapter goes into a lot of detail on that topic. To begin with, this shloka informs us that we need to arm ourselves with two weapons: discrimination or \u201cviveka\u201d, and dispassion or \u201cvairagya\u201d.   Let first look at discrimination. If we have followed the teaching so far, we know that material objects are are temporary and are not the true sources of happiness. But it is extremely easy to forget this teaching, especially if we have strong vasanaas and desires.   Therefore, we have to constantly arm ourselves with the weapon of discrimination by being always aware and alert about our thoughts and emotions. And we have to be especially alert when we are around objects that we are attached to. For a simple example take food: it could be chocolates for the sweet tooth person, fried food for the obese person etc.   Next comes dispassion. If we constantly practice discrimination, dispassion will happen automatically. Objects, people and situations will begin to lose their hold on us. Dispassion will prevent our energy from rushing out into the world of material objects through our senses. This is what the shloka means by the phrase \u201cone who controls his senses by his mind.\u201d   Finally, once the mind has gained back control over the senses, then the energy that once rushed out through our senses can be channeled into performing karmayoga. The next shloka will go deeper into what Shri Krishna means by karmayoga.   Footnotes   1. Verse 375 of Shankarachaarya\u2019s Vivekachoodamani speaks of dispassion and discrimination as \u201ctwo wings of a bird\u201d that lift the seeker into realization."

But this message has the potential to be dangerous if it is misinterpreted.   Under the banner of becoming more spiritual, some people put their bodies through extreme fasting, while some forcibly repress their urges. We see a milder version of this behaviour when individuals are trying to rid themselves of addictions by simply cutting off the supply or going \u201ccold-turkey\u201d.   For example, if one has an addiction to alcohol, one tries not to keep alcohol in the house to avoid temptation. That may work in the short term, but an addiction is not in the body, it is in the mind. It is like any other vasanaa and will come up as a desire when one sees alcohol the next time.   So in this shloka, Shri Krishna issues a strong warning to anyone who thinks that they can advance on the spiritual path through extreme repression of the body or of the mind. He uses a strong term to admonish such individuals by calling them hypocrites.   Let\u2019s connect this shloka to the previous one. It informed us that the body, mind and intellect comprise the three gunaas. These gunaas born of prakriti will always compel us to perform actions. But the current shloka tells us that repression of action will not lead to elimination of desires. We have no choice but to perform action, yet we need clear up our desires and vasanaas.   So what\u2019s the conclusion? We have to find a way to eliminate vasanaas WHILE we are performing actions. That technique is karma yoga."

But if we pay close attention, we will begin to hear the chirping of the crickets, the babble of a brook, the fluttering of wings and so on.   Watching all the actions going on in the forest reminds us of a simple fact. It is the tendency of nature or \u201cprakriti\u201d to act continuously. It never stays action-less even for a moment. Even a rock that seems action-less is undergoing geological change that is visible only after thousands or millions of years.   Now lets shift our attention to the human body. It too, is constructed by nature. It is composed of substances derived from the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe, all products of nature. If our body is made of components born out of nature, wouldn\u2019t it also follow the tendency of nature towards continuous action?   Therefore, Shri Krishna informs us that all beings have no choice but to act, because all beings are made up of prakriti. He explains that prakriti is nothing but three gunaas \u2013 energies or forces that make up this entire universe. These three energies are: rajas which causes movement, tamas which causes inertia, and sattva which maintains harmony between movement and inertia. This topic is taken up in great detail in later chapters.   In this way, Shri Krishna addresses the question raised earlier: \u201cWhy can\u2019t I retire to the forest and cease all action?\u201d We cannot, because the gunaas that we are made up are born out of nature, and nature never ceases to act continuously.   If this answer still does not satisfy us, let\u2019s try to sit still for three hours. Even if we somehow manage to physically sit still, our minds will be racing with thoughts.

We saw this in the first chapter where he went to the extent of suggesting that he become a monk. Shri Krishna wanted to address that issue in this shloka.   First, let us understand what is meant by the word \u201cactionlessness\u201d in this shloka. Like many words in scriptures, it is not meant to be taken literally. The word \u201cactionlessness\u201d points to the ultimate state of the \u201csthithaprajnya\u201d from the previous chapter. In this state, the vaasanaas have been so thoroughly eliminated that all action becomes completely selfless. There is absolutely no trace of selfishness. The word \u201cSiddhim\u201d or the state of perfection in the second half of the shloka, also refers to this state.   So therefore, Shri Krishna warned Arjuna that \u201cactionlessness\u201d cannot be attained by not starting a new action, nor by giving up actions that have already started. It would be similar to cutting off a plant without plucking its roots. Until our vaasanaas have been completely eradicated, they will keep generating desires which will lead us to selfish actions. But once vasanaas have been eradicated, only selfless actions will remain.   Now, some of us who are not fully convinced by this argument could still say: \u201cI will renounce all actions right now and move to a quiet solitary place. If I just sit still for a long time, my desires will automatically melt away\u201d. Shri Krishna addresses this point in the next shloka."

Shri Krishna addresses that question here. According to him, none of the two is either superior or inferior.   Sant Jnyaneshwar provides an example to show that none of these paths are superior or inferior: like a west-flowing river and an east-flowing river that both meet the same ocean, both paths are same.   Now, even thought the paths are complementary, there is a subtle difference between them. Let us explore this difference. Consider a child who is in the first grade. Even if he wants to, he cannot jump straight to a masters degree. He would have to finish high school, then college, and only then will he be ready for his masters degree.   In the same way, most of us are at a stage in life where we are active and want to make a contribution to the world. For such yogis or active individuals, the path of action is the most appropriate. Once we reach a stage where we exhaust all of our desires, we can transcend the path of action to pursue the path of knowledge, just like we transcend college education to pursue our masters degree.   I used to know a classmate from school that was a math prodigy. He could solve advanced calculus equations in sixth grade. The teachers used to check with him whether they were teaching sixth grade math correctly, such was his prowess. He did not need to go through elementary math, he was ready for his math PhD even at that young age.   Similarly, there are a few rare individuals who are at an advanced stage of their spiritual journey. They have eliminated most of their desires. Only such rare contemplative individuals can directly pursue the path of knowledge. For most of us, the path of action is the way to go. And karmayoga, or the path of action, is the main subject covered in this chapter.   On a different note, we see that Shri Krishna is hinting that he is something more that the cowherd son of Vasudeva here. We know this because he mentions that he himself has created this two-fold path for realizing the eternal essence. This has not slipped past Arjuna, he will ask this question at the right time."

As we saw last time, Arjuna did not fully comprehend the teaching from the second chapter. Being a military man, one who is trained in issuing and receiving terse orders in battlefield, he needed clear and simple instructions. Shri Krishna\u2019s covered the entire essence of the Gita in the second chapter. So therefore, Arjuna asked Shri Krishna to reveal what was most appropriate for him at this point in time.   Let\u2019s refer to the student of music from the prior example. A student who starts his formal training in classical music usually attends a \u201cclassical music 101\u201d course which covers topics such as the types of classical music, renowned composers and their compositions, the evolution of music through several centuries and so on. But, the teaching that is most beneficial to the beginner student is simple concepts like how to locate a note on the piano and so on.   The second chapter of the Gita is just like the classical music 101 course that covers lot of topics and techniques. With his mind bewildered by all that was heard, Arjuna asked Shri Krishna to provide the one technique that was most appropriate for Arjuna at this stage in his spiritual journey.   Shri Krishna understood Arjuna\u2019s situation and provided an answer in the next shloka."

It is wonderful to see the give-and-take between a student and a disciple come up several times in the Gita, making it more accessible and human. Let us dig deeper into Arjuna\u2019s question.   In the last chapter, Shri Krishna introduced the topic of karma yoga, where one performs selfless action. But later, he spoke about the knowledge of the eternal essence. Arjuna interpreted this as a statement that knowledge is superior to wisdom, and wanted to clarify whether it was so.   As an analogy, I remember the experience of learning music. In most cases, new students of music gave more importance to performing a popular song on stage, than to endure the rigour and discipline of daily finger drills that could get repetitive and boring. Similarly, Arjuna thought that knowledge was superior in action.   Arjuna also referred to his fighting in the war as a \u201chorrible\u201d action. This word speaks a lot about his mental state. Shri Krishna had taught him that one should maintain equanimity in pleasant and unpleasant situations. But Arjuna had not internalized and assimilated the teaching.   This is not uncommon. Our experience will usually indicate that a one-time hearing or \u201cshravana\u201d of any teaching will not be enough. We also need to reflect on the teaching, which is also known as \u201cmanana\u201d. And finally, we have to internalize it so that it becomes part of our personality \u2013 \u201cnidhidhyaasana\u201d.   In the next shloka, Arjuna completes his question to Shri Krishna."

        "content": "Since the second chapter is said to contain the essence of the entire Gita, let\u2019s try to recap the main points before we move to the third chapter:         1. Shri Krishna points out the error in Arjuna\u2019s thinking, in that Arjuna\u2019s personality was shaken by grief and delusion towards his kinsmen2. He advises Arjuna to correct the error by learning the knowledge of the eternal essence3. He describes the means to attain the eternal essence4. He also describes the characteristics of the individual who has realized the eternal essence.        We can summarize the technique to attain the eternal essence into 3 stages:1. Attain steadfastness in selfless action by pursuing one\u2019s svadharma2. Attain steadfastness in devotion to a higher ideal3. Attain steadfastness in the knowledge of the eternal essence or tattva-jnyana           Footnotes1. Most commentators agree that the chapters of the Gita map to the Upanishadic statement \u201cTat tvam asi\u201d or \u201cYou are that\u201d.

As a side note, this word is pronounced as \u201cbruh-mun\u201d and not \u201cbrah-mun\u201d.   So what exactly is this brahman? It is nothing but the eternal essence that Shri Krishna described in the earlier shlokas of this chapter. It is eternal, timeless, changeless, and pervades the entire universe. And when this abstract notion of the eternal essence takes a name and a form, it is known as Ishvara or God.   Therefore, if one follows the technique of karma yoga and attains the state of a person of steady wisdom or \u201cstithaprajnya\u201d, that person attains oneness with brahman, or in other words, attains God. Also, even if we only attain this state at the time of death, we will still achieve oneness with brahman.   Shri Krishna concludes the second chapter of the Gita with this shloka. As we saw before, the second chapter contains the essence of the entire Gita. So, why should we read the next 16 chapters? Let us take up this question.   Shri Krishna has packed several lifetimes worth of instruction into the second chapter. Most of us will never get it just by reading the second chapter. So Shri Krishna has taken up each point in the second chapter and elaborated it further in the remainder of the Gita. He clarifies key points in the teaching, resolves seemingly conflicting statements, and makes everything practical and accessible to all kinds of readers.   Now, some of us would have approached the Gita to further our spiritual quest, and some of us with a very practical bent. We should not assume that the remainder of the Gita will only go deeper into the spiritual aspects. There are tons of practical lessons that will improve our daily lives and make us better human beings, even if we choose to disregard the spiritual aspects of the Gita.   Having concluded the second chapter in our journey, we will summarize the main points of the second chapter and get a sense of what\u2019s coming ahead next.   om tatsatiti shreematbhagavatgitasupanishadsu brahmavidyaayaam yogashaastre shreekrishnaarjunsamvade saankhyayogo naama dvitiyodhyaayaha || 2 ||"

To that end, he asked Shri Krishna to answer the following questions: how does he sit, speak and walk. In this shloka, hence the use of the word \u201ccharati\u201d meaning \u201cwalks\u201d.   Shri Krishna summarizes the entire topic of the signs of a wise person in four points. He first asks us to give up selfish desires using the technique of karma yoga. Next, he asks us to give up cravings for things we already possess, which is the second point here. And to eliminate even the slightest trace of selfishness, he finally asks us to give up the sense of \u201cI-ness\u201d and \u201cmine-ness\u201d which we had seen in the first chapter, also known as \u201cahankaara\u201d\u2018 and \u201cmamataa\u201d. The goal attained by giving up these four things is also repeated here for emphasis: it is everlasting peace.   As a point of clarification, let us remember that for most of us, abandoning these four things will not happen overnight. We have to follow a disciplined technique to do so, and only after having applied this technique for a period of time will be begin to see the desires, cravings, ego and mine-ness slowly lose their grip.   With this shloka, Shri Krishna concludes the final topic of the second chapter, that of the signs of a wise person. The next shloka will be the last shloka in the second chapter, a wonderful milestone in our journey."

No matter how many streams enter the ocean, regardless of how gently or how forcefully they enter it, the ocean always remains calm and undisturbed.   In the same way, an individual of steady wisdom does not get impacted by any number of material objects or desires that he experiences. They fail to disturb his state of equanimity. Furthermore, even if the individual has to get angry in order to perform his svadharma in the material world, he is rooted in tranquility. And that is just like the ocean surface could experience stormy weather, but remain tranquil underneath the surface.   On the other hand, the person who is steeped in ignorance and does not possess wisdom will never attain peace. Here he is called the \u201cdesirer of desires\u201d. In other words, this person still thinks that harbouring and fulfilling desires will lead to peace and happiness. The fundamental shift from selfish desire oriented work to svadharma prompted work has not happened for him.   Note the change in meter to emphasize the point made in this shloka."

Let us try to understand it to the best of our ability. First, let\u2019s consider an example that will make the understanding of this shloka easier.   When a lay person and a professional artist enter a museum, both of them find joy in appreciating the works of art. The lay person may get excited about seeing how accurately an artist has painted a portrait. But the professional artist may find joy in more subtler aspects of the very same painting, e.g. what brush strokes were used, which time period was the painting commissioned in, what were the influences and so on \u2013 aspects that the lay person is probably totally oblivious to.   So therefore, in this shloka, Shri Krishna is speaking about two groups of individuals: ones who maintain the state of equanimity and ones who don\u2019t. Both groups have to live in this world of material objects, and both of them have to face ups and downs in life. The key difference in both groups is their vision.   For most individuals, the world of material objects is their end goal, they are \u201cawake\u201d to it, and the eternal essence is like night to them. But for the individuals of equanimity, the world of material objects loses importance \u2013 that world is like night to them. They are awake to the timeless, changeless eternal essence."

Let us summarize the main points of this topic.   The senses have the power to destabilize the mind, and consequently, destroy the intellect\u2019s capability to make proper judgements. The best way to control the senses is to practice one\u2019s svadharma with devotion to a higher ideal. If we don\u2019t, then even a stray thought about a material object will escalate into a chain of events that will bring about our downfall.   Changing the quality and direction of thoughts towards a higher ideal will result in a tranquil psyche, enabling us to move in the world of material objects without attachment or revulsion. And ultimately, this will result in peace and happiness.   A pictorial description of this topic was provided in the form of a rudderless ship at sea, that is blown here and there by wind. The wind represents the senses, the ship our mind, and the direction, our wisdom.   In the next shloka, Shri Krishna begins to conclude the second chapter of the Gita."

In the same way, just one sense organ \u2013 the eye seeing something tempting, the ear hearing some gossip, the tongue tasting alcohol \u2013         one sense organ can bring the mind under submission. In doing so, it can take away the intellect\u2019s capacity to function.

In this shloka, he echoes the same point, but uses negative inference to drive it home.   Here, he says that if the mind and senses constantly wander, our psyche is agitated. An agitated psyche will never allow an intellect to focus. And we have already seen in earlier shlokas the disadvantages of not having focused intellect or \u201cvyavasaayaatmika buddhi\u201d.

In this set of shlokas, he explains the exact opposite scenario, where bringing the senses and the mind under control brings us to a state of happiness. Here\u2019s the sequence of events:   Bring senses and mind under control -> one becomes devoid of attraction and revulsion -> he can experience the material world without any problem -> his mind becomes tranquil -> his intellect becomes steady -> he has no more sorrow -> he attains the state of happiness.   So, if one continues to pursue one\u2019s svadharma, and stay devoted to a higher ideal, one gets to a stage of equanimity. We have learned this in earlier shlokas. But then, what next? This set of shlokas tells us that performance of svadharma has a purifying effect \u2013 it is like a flame that burns away our vasanaas. As the vasanaas burn away, our minds remain situated in equanimity \u2013 and that\u2019s when our sorrows diminish.   We are always looking at quick fixes to be happy \u2013 new job, new friends, read a new book, move to a new place etc. But what comes across in these shlokas is that a long-term state of happiness cannot be found in a quick fix solution. All we can do is follow our svadharma, fix a higher goal, and keep at it."

Let\u2019s first examine the sequence of events from constant thinking all the way upto desire using the Ipod example from earlier :   A person has thoughts about ipod on sale -> gets attached to that ipod deal -> desire to buy ipod on sale is created.   Now, at this point, he has purchased the Ipod and is extremely attached to it. Even without going forward in the sequence, we can see that the material desire to procure an Ipod has taken the person away from performing his svadharma. His equanimity has already been disturbed. He is dragged back into the material world, and has taken one step backwards from moksha or freedom.   Let\u2019s move forward in the sequence:   Ipod breaks down -> he is angry that it has broken down -> he completely loses his equanimity -> takes anger out on his wife -> family environment is agitated.   Here, not only has he completely lost his equanimity, but has also caused pain to other members of his family. So the message here is that constant pondering and thinking about objects eventually leads to moving away from equanimity, hence it is to be avoided, or at least minimized to the extent possible.   An interesting point seen here is around anger. Per the shlokas, anger is caused when one\u2019s desire gets obstructed. Also, attachment to a concept such as one\u2019s job title or position causes continual waves of thought, anger and delusion, in other words, stress.         Therefore, these shlokas provide an ancient but relevant analysis of anger and stress."

This subject comes under the umbrella of the \u201csthitaprajna lakshana\u201d, or the signs of a wise individual, and comprises the final portion of the second chapter. As a reminder, the four major portions of the second chapter are : 1) Shri Krishna convincing Arjuna that his logic was incorrect 2) providing the correct logic and understanding to Arjuna 3) providing the practical aspects of the teaching 4) describing the attributes of the man of steady wisdom. We are the the final topic right now.   In the last shloka, Shri Krishna described how the turbulent senses can ruin the mind. In this shloka, he provides a prescription to remedy the impact of the senses: set a goal that is higher than yourself, and channel your mind and your senses towards that higher goal. The senses, along with the mind, will detach from material objects only when they are shown a higher goal. They cannot detach without attaching themselves to a higher goal. Otherwise, we end up forcibly suppressing the senses, which we all know is not healthy.   This shloka also hints at the topic of meditation, which is a disciplined technique of fixing the mind to a higher goal. In meditation, an individual sits and gradually brings attention to one and only one thought. And that thought is nothing but the higher goal that we have set for ourself. The most unique thing in this shloka is that Shri Krishna uses the word \u201cme\u201d, in other words, he asks us to make him the higher goal.   Now, at this stage in the spiritual journey, if you feel comfortable with making devotion to Shri Krishna your ultimate goal, that is fine. Otherwise, you can set any selfless goal that is greater than you \u2013 for example, serving your parents, serving your family, serving your organization, serving the country etc.   Setting a higher goal is the only way that your senses and your mind will come under control. It also ensures that your ego does not puff up thinking that it has controlled the senses."

This will be true even if we are not near those objects. Some of us may raise an objection to this statement. We may ask: \u201cAs long as I control my actions, what difference does it make if I think about an object such as a chocolate cake? It won\u2019t matter because I won\u2019t eat it, Correct?\u201d        In this shloka, Shri Krishna responds to the objection. He says that thoughts can catch us at a time of weakness, when we are least alert, and undo all of our self control. These thoughts are generated by our predispositions or vasanaas.        Vasanaas are like dormant embers of coal that burn stronger when the senses add fuel to their fire. They are the seeds of thoughts, or \u201cthought generators\u201d. This means that self control of actions is effective, but only to a certain extent, because self control does not tackle vasanaas. It is like trimming a weed instead of uprooting it completely.        Another aspect is pointed out here. One may practice conquering one\u2019s senses for a long time. That person can become an advanced practitioner through years of diligence and perseverance. He may come to the conclusion that all of his desires and vasanaas have been vanquished. But the senses and the mind are extremely clever; they will wait for months, even years, and then generate a thought that can destabilize his equanimity in a second.        In summary, it is not enough to control our actions in order to maintain equanimity, we have to remain alert and watch our thoughts as well."

It does work assuming we remain aware and alert about our thoughts. But if we have strong predispositions or vaasanaas towards any object, person or situation, the memory or \u201ctaste\u201d of that factor will keep popping up in our mind. So in this shloka, Shri Krishna provides an overview of how one begins to address the removal of deep rooted predispositions, which is one of the primary goals of any spiritual teaching.   Let\u2019s go back to the black forest chocolate cake example from last time. You saw a piece of cake, you realized that you may succumb to it, and you took a few steps back. But a little later, the taste of that cake from a prior experience will pop up in your mind and begin to torment you. All you can think of for a while will be cake. This is what makes dieting difficult. Our mind keeps pushing us towards food each time we try to restrain ourselves.   So what is the solution? In the shloka, Shri Krishna says that the taste also turns away when we \u201crealize the absolute\u201d. What he means is that we need to set our goal on something higher than ourselves, and hold on to that goal throughout our life. The higher the goal, the greater chance that we will get rid of our predispositions.   When we begin any diet, we typically set a goal, e.g. \u201cI have to lose 2 kg in 3 weeks\u201d. Now, with this shloka in mind, we could try to set a higher goal, which could be \u201cI need to lose this weight so that I can stay healthy to take care of my family\u201d. Or it could be \u201cI need to lose this weight so that I can fulfill my svadharma in the best possible manner\u201d.   In later chapters, the Gita goes into great detail as to how we can gradually set higher and higher goals and ultimately set the highest goal, the \u201cabsolute\u201d goal mentioned in this shloka, so that we can burn away all of our predispositions."

Let\u2019s say, we detect that one of these factors has presented itself to us. What should we do? He gives a beautiful example from the world of nature to address this point.   Whenever a tortoise senses danger, he withdraws his limbs into his shell. The shell is strong enough to withstand any adverse situation. And once that situation passes, he brings his limbs back into the world. Similarly, if we detect that an object, person or situation is about to disturb our equanimity, Shri Krishna advises us to bring our intellect into the picture, and completely withdraw our attention from that object, person or situation.   In one commentary on this topic, we learn that most animals have one sense organ as their weakness. The deer has sound, the elephant has touch, the moth has sight (fire), the fish has taste, and the bee has smell as its weakness. So for example, if a moth sees fire, it loses all control and flies straight into the fire. However, human beings have all five senses as their weakness, making this technique all the more important.   The most practical application of this technique is dieting. If we have a sweet tooth like we saw earlier, and we see a large slice of black forest chocolate cake in front of us, we have to apply the \u201ctortoise technique\u201d and move some steps away from that cake. It also means that we do not keep large stocks of chocolates, cakes etc. in our house because we may be tempted very easily.   Here\u2019s another related point. In India, many aspects of spiritual practices are embedded in our customs, but sometimes we do not realize their significance. We may have noticed a sculpture of a tortoise outside many Indian temples, which is an instruction to withdraw our worldly matters and enter the temple with a devotional mindset. But instead of doing so, we tend to whisper about worldly matters into the tortoise\u2019s ear, which is exactly the opposite of the original intent.   Footnotes   1. The example on 5 animals and their weaknesses is from Vivekachoodamani by Adi Shankarachaarya"

In this shloka, Shri Krishna points out how that person responds to beneficial and adverse outcomes of his expectations.   This shloka uses an interesting word \u201canabhisneha\u201d, which means without affection. The root of this word is \u201csniha\u201d which means \u201cto stick\u201d. Most of us tend to get stuck to objects, people and situations that we encounter in our lives. And it is that stickiness which gets us into trouble.   An example from the corporate world would be a consultant who is hired for a 3 month assignment verses a full time employee who is given a similar assignment. The consultant comes in, does what she is supposed to do, submits her report and moves on to the next assignment, without getting entangled in office politics. Whereas the employee gets \u201cstuck\u201d to the job and gets entangled in all kinds of office politics, who he should align himself with, etc.   So therefore, if one remains unattached and works towards a goal, he gains the objectivity to remain the same whether he succeeds or fails in accomplishing that goal. He knows that he was there before that success or failure happened, he was there during it, and he will be there after it as well. Therefore whatever happened can be easily dealt with. In no way does he let any adverse outcome demotivate him.   How can we apply this practically? For example, if we worked hard for a project and someone criticizes us, internally we should remain steady and evaluate whether the criticism is valid or mean-spirited. If it is valid, we take the feedback positively. If it is mean-spirited, we ignore it. But if we are too attached to the work, we will lose our equanimity each time someone criticizes us."

In this shloka, he says that the person of steady intellect does not let joy or sorrow upset his equanimity. Now does that mean that the person becomes a stone? No. As long as we are alive, it is natural to experience joy and sorrow. But if we notice that any joyful or sorrowful situation has upset our equanimity for a prolonged period of time, we should be on guard. There usually is an underlying selfish desire at work.   For instance, if you know that your favourite dish was planned to be cooked for dinner, but is no longer being cooked because of some reason, you will get disappointed. But if this disappointment persists for a long period of time, it means that you have a deep-seated desire for that dish, which can resurface anytime to cause you further agitation. The goal pointed our in the prior shloka is to free ourselves of as many material desires as possible, and to be \u201cself satisfied with one\u2019s self\u201d.   The second part of the shloka goes deeper into this point by describing how a desire can give rise to fear and anger, both of which cause instability of mind. At the time of writing this, it is the thanksgiving holiday, so it is apt to look at a shopping example. Let\u2019s say that you go window shopping and see an ipod that is on sale with a huge discount. Later, you head home but all you can think about is that ipod. That\u2019s all it takes \u2013 you have developed attachment to it.   But that\u2019s not all. Right there, you will also develop a fear that it may go out of stock tomorrow, and that you will lose the deal. So you go to the store to buy it the very next day. Now, after a couple of days it stops working. You call the tech support phone number and are kept on hold for 20 minutes. What do you think has arisen in your mind? Anger, of course. And all it took was a desire to take hold of your mind when you saw the ipod. In later shlokas, Shri Krishna gives a more detailed, step by step breakdown of how a simple little thought can bring about one\u2019s downfall.   Footnotes   1. In the example, the individual imagined that the Ipod, which is nothing but a material object, would give him happiness. Whereas in reality, there is no happiness \u201cbuilt into\u201d the ipod. This projection of happiness onto a material object is termed as \u201cshobhana adhyasa\u201d."

Similarly, from this shloka onwards, Shri Krishna lists all the factors that can destabilize our state of equanimity. If we keep track of these factors, and remain alert and aware when we encounter them, then we will never lose our mental balance and equanimity. This portion of the chapter is a very practical summary of the entire teaching of the Gita.   In this shloka, Shri Krishna advises us to monitor our material desires, i.e. track how many are arising, how many we have fulfilled, and so on. As we saw earlier, continual harbouring of material desires has the effect of destablizing our mental balance, and takes us further away from state of equanimity. Therefore, a man of steady wisdom is one who has learned to give up all such desires.   Now this is especially true when we have predisposition to some object, situation or person. This predisposition is also known as \u201cvaasana\u201d. Predispositions are the seeds of thought and desire. For instance, let\u2019s say we have a sweet tooth. Then, anytime we see a piece of chocolate, that desire will enter the mind, and we will begin thinking of how we can acquire that chocolate. If we are performing some work, the constant thinking of the chocolate will destabilize our mind and prevent us from focusing on the task at hand. So this shloka asks us to closely examine our predispositions as well as our desires.   Since this person of steady wisdom has extinguished all his desires, he is always content and does not need to rush out into the world of material objects. This is because he has realized his association with the eternal essence, which pervades the entire universe and therefore is always complete and content. Therefore, he will be \u201cself-satisfied in his own self\u201d, as this shloka points out."

When we saw him last, he was in the midst of a panic attack. The extremely thoughtful question posed by him tells us that his mind has now calmed down, and that he has been following the teaching diligently. He now asks Shri Krishna to elaborate on the practical aspect of the teaching, since more time was spent on the theoretical part.   Arjuna was a warrior, and a very practical person. So he was less interested in abstract theoretical concepts. He wanted to know about the internal and external characteristics of a person who was steeped in equanimity. For a warrior, one of the best ways to learn to use a new weapon is to mimic someone who is skilled at using it. Therefore, Arjuna wanted to know how he could emulate that person who is always established in equanimity, here called a \u201csthita-prajna\u201d or a person of steady wisdom.   The second half of the shloka contains questions that seem a bit odd to us. Why would Arjuna want to know how someone speaks, sits or walks? These questions are not meant to be taken literally. Speaking and walking refer to how an individual transacts in this world.         Sitting refers to what is his perspective and attitude towards the world. That\u2019s what Arjuna wanted to know.   Let us take stock of where we are. We had seen that Shri Krishna was covering 4 main topics: 1) Informing Arjuna that his logic and reasoning was incorrect 2) Explaining the correct logic and reasoning to Arjuna 3) Providing practical guidance to implement this correct logic and reasoning 4) Describing the attributes of the individual who follows this teaching.

In this shloka, Shri Krishna indicates the final stage of yoga where the intellect never loses its grounding.   In the initial stages of our spiritual journey, we will begin to experience moments of equanimity. These moments will be short and fleeting, but that is ok. As we continue to practice equanimity, these moments will grow longer and become more frequent. But there is always some thing \u2013 a thought from the past, a critical statement uttered by a friend, an object that we crave \u2013 that takes us out of equanimity and back into the world of moha.   So what should we aim for? We should aim for something better. Here\u2019s an example. When the internet was new, most of us connected to it using a dial-up modem. Each time we needed to access the internet, we had to establish a connection, and then disconnect it once done. As technology improved, we began to connect through it via cable or DSL connections. These connections are \u201calways on\u201d, so there was no need to connect and disconnect everytime. Now no one wants to ever go back to using dial up modems.   So therefore, this shloka gives us a picture of the most advanced state of yoga where one is always in a state of equanimity, no matter what the circumstance. And when this happens, we will be always connected to the imperceptible, incomprehensible eternal essence. This is the only way to attain the eternal essence. When that happens, this state is called \u201csamaadhi\u201d, which will the the culmination of one\u2019s spiritual journey."

Now in this shloka and the next, he offers us pointers to assess whether we are progressing on the spiritual path or not. He mentions that one who is always established in equanimity becomes indifferent to hearing about any topic. But that is just the literal meaning. Here it also refers to seeing, touching, feeling and smelling, i.e. any object perceived through our senses.   Let\u2019s look at this in more detail. Also note that it we have gone through similar situations already in our lives, so this should not be something unknown to us.   Growing up as a teenager in the 1990s, WWF wrestling was considered a phenomenon. We would watch it diligently when it came on TV, read about it in magazines, and discuss it among friends non stop. But as we grew up we realized that it was staged entertainment, and not a real sport. And in time, like many other things, we outgrew the fascination for it. So now as adults when we see WWF on TV, we just change the channel and don\u2019t even think twice about it. We have become indifferent to WWF.   Now a wonderful poetic phrase \u2013 quagmire of delusion \u2013 is used here. What exactly is moha or delusion? In case of the WWF, we were under the delusion that WWF would give us happiness. But more broadly, moha refers to the error of pursuing of the material world as a source of happiness, as opposed to realizing the eternal essence. Therefore, as one practices equanimity and moves ahead on the spiritual path, the material world slowly loses appeal.   So as you begin to practice equanimity through performance of svadharma, try to keep track of your attachment to material objects. You will begin to observe that slowly, your attraction to the material world will start to weaken. This state of ultimate indifference to the material world is the state of \u201cparam vairagya\u201d or ultimate indifference."

Here, he tells us that one who continually practices Karmayoga frees himself from the entanglements of birth. Let\u2019s look at this in more detail.   Our experience tells us that desires are never ending. Most material desires, once fulfilled, give rise to new ones. For instance, most immigrants to a country such as the US usually arrive with modest means. They rent a flat till they know where they plan to settle long term. And then the desires begin to manifest.   In a few years they take out a loan to buy a house. A house usually has a lawn. So you need a lawnmover, a leafblower, fertilizer, sprinkler system and so on to take care of the lawn. In addition, you need a car to get around. In time, one car is not enough \u2013 you need two. And since the neighbour has a Mercedes, you need to get one as well. Similarly with a TV \u2013 you start with 32 inch, then 60 inch, then 3D capability, home theatre system etc. Each desire, once fulfilled, gives birth to a new one.   So the shloka here says that this endless cycle of desire after desire entangles us in the material world. And therefore, one uses the discipline of Karmayoga to break out of it so that you reach that state where there are no desires or blemishes in one\u2019s personality \u2013 what is termed here as the immaculate state.   Let\u2019s summarize the key points of Karmayoga that we have seen in this chapter. Karmayoga is the performance of actions with equanimity of mind. We also looked at a 3-step toolkit to implement Karmayoga in our lives:   1. Reduce unnecessary thoughts of material objects that do not pertain to our svadharma   2. Improve quality of necessary thoughts by removing extreme attachment and hatred   3. Perform actions focusing on the present moment, without attachment to the result of action"

        "content": "buddhiyukto jahaateeha ubhe sukritadushkrite |   tasmaadyogaaya yujyasva yogah karmasu kaushalam || 50 ||   One who is equipped with equanimity in this life discards both merit and sin. Therefore remain established in yoga; yoga results in perfect action.   buddhiyuktaha : with equanimity   jahaati : give up   iha : here, in this life   ubhe : both   sukritadushkrite : merit and sin   tasmaat : therefore   yogaaya : in yoga   yujyasva : established   yogah : yoga   karmasu : in action   kaushalam : perfect   In the last chapter, Arjuna raised several concerns to Shri Krishna while debating whether or not to fight the Kaurava army. One of the concerns was that he would incur sin if he killed his kinsmen. Having given the overview of the topic of Karmayoga, Shri Krishna wanted to now address Arjuna\u2019s concern around sin.   In this shloka, Shri Krishna told Arjuna that if one follows the path of Karmayoga, i.e. performs svadharma with equanimity, one doesn\u2019t have to constantly ponder whether an action will beget merit or sin. In fact, one goes beyond the accumulation of merit or sin. Why is that the case? If we begin to detach ourselves from the results or fruits of our actions, we will also not get attached to merit and sin. Both merit and sin, like results of an action, are future-oriented expectations, and have no place in Karmayoga.   For instance, consider a grapevine that produces grapes. It fully carries out its svadharma, which is to produce tasty grapes. But it is upto the one who processes the grapes to make grape juice out of those grapes, or to produce alcohol that probably ends up ruining an alcoholic\u2019s family. The grapevine does not incur merit or sin, it simply performs its svadharma.   There is another important point in this shloka. Earlier, we came across the definition of yoga as \u201cyoga is equanimity of mind during the performance of action\u201d. Now, Shri Krishna instructed Arjuna on another benefit of yoga. If one maintains equanimity of mind at all times, one\u2019s actions become perfect since they will be performed with total attention and dexterity, without any distractions. Therefore, there is no need worry about the result. The result will, without question, be beneficial.   Earlier, we had discussed trying Karmayoga using a simple exercise: washing dishes while giving complete and undivided attention to the task at hand. If you tried it, you may have noticed that it is almost impossible to focus the mind on the task. The mind, much like a child, darts either into the future or into the past. For now, let\u2019s continue to practice Karmayoga by doing simple household chores like washing dishes, but with focused attention. In the forthcoming shlokas, we will encounter more tools to bring equanimity to the mind."

In this shloka, he expresses his views on individuals acting with a selfish motive. To indicate his level of contempt for them, he calls them \u201cpitiable\u201d.   Lets say there is a large family living under one roof. Everyone has a part to play: some people work to bring in money, some are students, some take care of the house etc. Now, there is a large TV in the living room and anyone in the family can watch it. But, if one person starts monopolizing the TV and prevents others from watching it, what would you call that person? Wouldn\u2019t you call him selfish and pitiable? Well, the world we live in is no different than this large family. Any selfishly motivated actions eventually causes more harm than good.   Now, all of us will agree that acting in an unselfish manner is a good thing, in theory. But we very rarely practice it in our lives. Why is this so? The most common argument is that if we become unselfish, other selfish people will take advantage of us and we will probably \u201close\u201d in life.   So how do we address this argument? Acting with an unselfish attitude does not mean that we become weak-minded wimps. If someone is obstructing us from performing our svadharma, we should deal with that individual in a firm manner appropriately. And if we truly practice equanimity of mind while performing actions, we will respond to the situation using our intellect and not our emotions. Therefore we will not do something rash and harmful to the situation at hand.   Therefore, the teaching of Karmayoga encourages us to slowly change our attitude to one of unselfish action, and maintain equanimity of mind while performing actions."

Obviously, we will not be able to totally discard all our attachments in one day. This will take a long time. However, Shri Krishna asks us to slowly start treading on this path. Why is he asking us to do so? He wants us to diminish our hankering for the outcome of our actions, and the only way to do that is by reducing our attachments to the material world.   Consider a mother who takes care of her 5 year old child. She gets extremely attached to it and develops lots of expectations: my child will take care of me when it grows up, it will become a doctor etc. If those things don\u2019t happen, she will generate lots of sorrow for herself. But a nanny taking care of a child will not be attached to it. She will perform her svadharma by taking good care of child. However, she will have zero expectations from the child, and therefore she will be able to maintain equanimity in action.   The only difference between the mother and the nanny is their attitude \u2013 one is attached, one is unattached. And the one that has attachments has expectations for the future, the other does not.   Now in this shloka we encounter Shri Krishna defining the term \u201cyoga\u201d. It has nothing to do with arcane rituals. It has nothing to do with complex physical postures. It is a surprisingly simple and practical definition: equanimity of mind during performance of action. It is how the nanny operated in the earlier example.   So what is the practical technique to cast off attachments? How do we actually do this? We have to rid ourself of all expectations and worries about the future, as well as memories of the past. If we eliminate constant thinking about past and future, we can channel all that energy into the present moment and into executing the task at hand.   We probably have experienced instances in our lives where we were so joyfully and blissfully immersed in our work that we forgot where we were and what time it was. But those experiences were few and far between. By going deeper into each and every task we perform, no matter how big or small the task, we will minimize past and future thinking, which will enable us to remain balanced regardless of success and failure. This is the true definition of yoga.   To recap, our toolkit contains 3 techniques: reducing unnecessary thoughts, improving quality of thought, and focusing on the task and hand. We can practice this teaching with mundane tasks, and move on to more complex ones. Next time we wash dishes, lets give each movement of the hand our single and undivided attention, and try to sustain it while washing each and every dish. Give it a shot, see what happens.   Footnotes   1. There are four kinds of attachment: attachment to result (I want a reward for singing this song), action (I will sing a song only in my way), doership (I will song the song, not anyone else), non-doership (I am the non-singer of this song)."

Here Shri Krishna urges us to not worry about the outcome, i.e. the result, of the action. How will this work? Let\u2019s recap two important points. We have seen earlier that when we perform our svadharma, we derive joy from the performance of         action itself since we have the interest, desire and aptitude for it. We also learned in the last shloka that we do not have complete control over the outcome.   Therefore, we should never be motivated by the outcome when we know we have executed our actions with perfection, and that we do not have complete control on the outcome. Motivation for the outcome creates bondage \u2013 it is like a rope that ties us into the future. Instead, if we give up motivation for the outcome, there is no such binding created.   Let\u2019s address a few doubts that most of us may have when we hear this teaching. The first doubt could be : \u201cIf I am not motivated by the result, how will I know where I am heading? I want my project to be executed on time, I want my team to be inspired by a goal, I want progress in my career. How can I do all these things if I am not motivated by the result?\u201d   To answer this, lets closely look at what Shri Krishna has prescribed. There is nothing wrong with aiming for a specific goal, or even to be inspired by it. Setting a vision, defining a goal, making a plan \u2013 all these things are absolutely required for the perfect execution of any work. We can always be motivated by the goal, but not be motivated by the outcome. There is a subtle but important difference.   Another doubt could be as follows: \u201cIf I know that I am only partially responsible for the outcome then why should I do any action at all? I will just quit my job, sit at home and do nothing.\u201d   Shri Krishna cautions us not to do so in the last part of the shloka \u2013 do not get attached to inaction. If we know that we have performed our svadharma and our actions to the best of our abililty, we know that in the end we will achieve our goals, even if things may not turn out as anticipated sometimes. But we should never totally give up and do nothing.   What we have learned so far is just the tip of the iceberg. This shloka is the seed for the topic of Karmayoga, or the discipline of action. Shri Krishna expounds on this topic at great length in the forthcoming chapters. Arjuna has several questions and doubts in regards to this teaching, all of which will be addressed by Shri Krishna one by one."

There are many chapters in the Gita that go deeper into the layers and layers of meaning packed into this shloka. Given the richness of this shloka, we shall try to understand it to the best extent possible. Since there are several messages in this shloka, let\u2019s examine the teaching part by part.   Let\u2019s start with the first half of the shloka. The message is as follows. Shri Krishna says that we have authority only over the actions performed by us, but never on the result. In other words, we do not have complete control over the outcome of any activity. As we grow older and spend more time in this world, we know this fact instinctively. But because we forget it, we tend to get disappointed when things don\u2019t go our way, or get elated when things do.   Look at our own lives, we can take any number of examples to test this theory. Take a simple thing as catching a bus that has just arrived on the other side of the road. We run to catch the bus. But even in such a simple task, the outcome is not guaranteed. If we are able to catch the bus then all\u2019s well. But there are several other outcomes that could occur. The bus may leave before we get to the stop. We could catch the wrong bus. Once aboard, we may not have the fare. Worst of all, we could get hit by a car while crossing the road.   Or consider a complex task as a surgeon performing heart surgery. Take the world\u2019s best doctor trained at the world\u2019s best college, in the surgery room of the world\u2019s best hospital with the world\u2019s best surgery team. Even with all these things, that surgeon will never have a 100% success rate.   The outcome of any action is like an equation where we provide some of the variables, but not all of them. In fact, we may not even know all the variables that end up determining the outcome.   So unless we logically convince ourselves that we do not have complete control over the result of an action, we will not be able to learn the main teaching the second half of this shloka. We will tackle that teaching in the next post.   Footnotes   1. \u201cPhala\u201d literally means \u201cfruit\u201d. Fruit of a result has a \u201cseed\u201d in it, which has the potential to generate yet another action."

Think about your childhood. All of had a craving for toys when we were kids. But there came a stage when most of us outgrew toys because we began to think about higher things like career aspirations etc. So all toys began to look the same to us, regardless of the price, shape, size, colour, brand etc. , from a simple spinning top to an expensive model airplane.   Similarly, Shri Krishna says that once our thoughts become high quality, i.e. they pertain to our svadharma and to spiritual contemplation, then automatically we will begin to feel less need for any external entertainment and enjoyment.   Therefore, this shloka says that one who always maintains equanimity will have known all there is to know about the material world, and will begin to transcend worldly matters and knowledge.   In this shloka we notice that the word \u201cbraahmana\u201d appears. Braahmana here does not refer to the caste system meaning. It refers to an individual who is always contemplating about brahman, which is nothing but the eternal essence that we learned about in the early part of this chapter. Also the word Veda, like in previous verses, refers to worldly knowledge.   Now, the two techniques prescribed so far, reducing unnecessary thoughts and improving quality of thought, were preparatory techniques. They are meant to prepare us for learning the main technique of the teaching, which is covered in the next shloka. It is probably the most famous and oft-quoted shloka in the Gita. We shall cover it in great detail."

        "content": "traigunyavishayaa vedaa nistraigunyo bhavaarjuna |   nirdvandvo nityasatvastho niryogakshemam aatmavaan || 45 ||      The Vedas describe the three gunas. Transcend those gunas, O Arjuna. Free yourself from dualities, remain always in sattva, give up thinking about acquisition and preservation, and be established in the eternal essence.   traigunyavishayaaha : describe the three gunas   vedaaha : Vedas   nistraigunyaha : free from the 3 gunas   bhava : become   arjuna : O Arjuna   nirdvandvaha : free from dualities   nityasatvasthaha : steeped in sattva   niryogakshemam : free from acquisition and preservation   aatmavaan : established in the eternal essence   The first technique in our toolkit was the art of maintaining focus to reduce the quantity of unnecessary thoughts. Shri Krishna now provides us with the second technique in our toolkit: slowly improving the quality of our thoughts. This shloka is jam-packed with practical tips to improve our thought quality, so let\u2019s tackle this shloka part by part.   Firstly, an absolute prerequisite to improving thought quality is to be mindful of what we are thinking. Most of us tend to perform actions daily almost on autopilot. If we are not aware of what we are thinking while performing an action, we will not be able to improve the quality of our thoughts. Therefore, the shloka advises us to think deeply about whether any action we perform is selfish, or is in service of our svadharma. Doing so repeatedly will reveal the true nature of our thoughts.   Secondly, the shloka advises us to go beyond obsessive thinking about the interplay of the 3 gunas. In a nutshell, there are 3 types of gunas or tendencies that are responsible for creating everything in this material world. Therefore, the shloka advises us to start contemplating spiritual knowledge daily, which will automatically reduce material thoughts.   Thirdly, the shloka speaks about dualities. Dualities are the positive and negative mental labels associated with thoughts \u2013 love/hate, joyful/sorrowful, pleasurable/painful etc. So practically speaking, any thought that demonstrates extreme attachment or hatred towards an object, person or situation is a poor quality thought because it strengthens the ego. Whenever we catch ourselves saying something like \u201cI cannot live without watching TV everyday\u201d, we should be on guard. It is better to substitute that thought with something like \u201cI enjoy watching TV, but I can live without it if I want to\u201d. Similarly, if we have a thought like \u201cI want to kill my boss\u201d we can start to think \u201cMy boss is difficult to work with sometimes, but he is a human being just like anyone else\u201d.   Finally, the shloka advises us to stop worrying about acquisition and preservation. Most of us are worried about two things \u2013 acquiring something, and preserving something once it is acquired. A corporate executive will keep thinking about the promotion. And once he has it, he will do all he can to make sure he holds on to his new post. But the shloka informs us that as long as we are diligently performing our svadharma, we will automatically get what we need to live a good life. Therefore,we should stop obsessing over acquisition and preservation, which is an impediment to maintaining equanimity.   Let\u2019s summarize the techniques learned so far as follows. The first technique helped us reduce the quantity of unnecessary thoughts. The second technique helps us improve the quality of our thoughts by substituting poor quality thoughts with good quality thoughts. It is helpful to maintain a diary to track the quantity and quality of our thoughts, so that we can gauge our progress. It is no different than following a disciplined approach to losing weight or quitting smoking.   A question may arise here : \u201cHow can I stop thinking about the material world after I perform my svadharma? After I come home from work I need to watch TV, surf the web, watch movies, sports etc. in order to be entertained. Won\u2019t life become boring?\u201d The answer is provided in the next shloka."

Here, he describes the tendencies that will prevent someone from having that focus. In essence, what he is saying here is that any individual who only thinks about one material desire after another, will never reach the state of absolute equanimity. The word used in this shloka to describe that state is \u201csamaadhi\u201d.   Most of our youth is spent in gaining worldly knowledge. In the Gita,\u201dVedas\u201d can be interpreted as \u201call worldly knowledge\u201d from our standpoint. This knowledge is useful for performing our svadharma through our chosen profession. But most of us end up using this knowledge as a means to fulfill a never-ending stream of material desires, that will give us more and more pleasure and power. Our goal is never svadharma itself, it is material desires. And with each material desire, the shloka says that we are reborn.   The word rebirth here has a specific meaning. Each time you harbour a new material desire, you are \u201creborn\u201d. This is because each new material desire prompts you towards a whole new set of selfishly motivated actions, taking the focus away from your svadharma, and in doing so, moving you away from the ultimate goal of maintaining equanimity. For example, if you want a new car, you are reborn as a \u201ccar desiring individual\u201d who will put in extra effort to earn money for a new car. But by the time the new car arrives, several new desires have sprung up, resulting in new \u201crebirths\u201d.   Now, the shloka also mentions that such individuals hold heaven as the ultimate goal. The word \u201cheaven\u201d also has a specific meaning here. It does not refer to some place up in the sky. It refers to a future state where you will be happy after you fulfill your desire. But by shifting your focus towards heaven i.e. the future, you make your present moment unhappy. This kind of thinking also prompts you towards selfishly motivated action.   Therefore, these shlokas reiterate the importance of keeping a focused attitude towards maintaining equanimity, and one does that by not harbouring endless material desires."

This shloka explains the first technique in this toolkit: maintaining constant focus on the goal prescribed in the Gita teaching.   The goal mentioned in a prior shloka is clear to all of us : equanimity of mind in any situation. So the very first thing that Shri Krishna instructs us to make a promise to ourselves that \u201cI will only focus on one desire \u2013 that of maintaining equanimity. If it has nothing to do with my svadharma, I will not entertain that desire.\u201d   Consider an example. When Mr X visits the grocery store with a shopping list, he quickly and efficiently gets the items on the list and leaves the store. He is focused on acquiring the objects in his shopping list. But when he visits the mall or an electronics store, his mind starts entertaining \u201cmany-branched and infinite thoughts\u201d e.g : \u201cOh look at this new IPod\u201d, \u201cCan I get it cheaper here?\u201d, \u201cWhen\u2019s the new HDTV coming out\u201d etc. and eventually ends up spending over 3 hours in the mall. Therefore, focus is extremely important in any endeavour.   Now, let\u2019s assume we focus on the one desire to maintain equanimity. How do we know whether we are on the right track? To that end, this shloka very beautifully gives us a \u201cchecklist\u201d so that we can keep tabs on our focus. At some point every day, preferably at the end of the day, we should ask ourselves two questions and write down the answers in a journal:   1. What objects/people/situations did I keep obsessing about today?   2. How many of these obsessive thoughts did I have?   If we notice over time that the quantity of our obsessive thinking has begun to diminish, it means that our intellect is beginning to focus on the ultimate goal of the Gita teaching."

Or worse still, it may totally backfire and yield a negative result \u2013 he may burn the food which will set off a fire alarm.   Moreover, for most Indians who hold the Gita in high reverence, we may harbour a notion that any teaching of the Gita needs to be followed to the letter, like a priest who recited mantras at a puja. And if we don\u2019t do this, we will incur sin.   Shri Krishna reassures Arjuna that the teaching of buddhi yoga is absolutely risk free. It will not result in \u201cabhikrama-naasha\u201d or error caused by not following the steps correctly. It will also not create \u201cpratyavaha dosha\u201d,         i.e. yielding a negative result.   Therefore, Shri Krishna informs us that there is absolutely no excuse for holding back in implementing these teachings due to fear of any sort. Even if we practice a little bit of this teaching, it protects us from the most massive fear \u2013 the fear of death."

The remaining shlokas in the second chapter are extremely practical and can be immediately used in our daily lives. They will enable us to conduct our svadharma while always keeping the attitude specified in the prior shloka : treat any situation, joyful or sorrowful, with equanimity.   The word yoga comes twice in this shloka, so let\u2019s examine it more closely. Usually, we think of yoga as an ancient art of physical exercise. However, the word yoga in the Bhagavad Gita has a different meaning. Translated into English, the meaning is a mix between the words technique and discipline. In fact, as we saw earlier, each chapter of the Gita is a yoga, or a technique and discipline, unto itself.   There is an interesting word in the last part of this shloka \u2013 \u201cbonds of action\u201d. It almost seems like a thick rope exists, one end tied to our leg and the other end tied to the action. What does is bondage?   An action that increases extreme attachment or hatred towards anything \u2013 an object, person or situation \u2013 \u201cbinds\u201d us to that thing. It is similar to addiction. We may smoke a cigarette once, but unless we have high self control, we want to experience it again. This desire to repeat the experience eventually results in an addiction and we cannot live without it.   The important point here is that no action or object cannot bind us; it is the thought behind it that binds. For a non-smoker, a pack of cigarettes does not cause bondage. Conversely, for a smoker, just the mere sight of the pack of cigarettes prompts him to smoke. For things subtler than addiction, we can tell whether or not an action will cause bondage by checking whether it is for the service of one\u2019s selfish ego or not.   Consider an executive making a presentation to her management team. One scenario could be that she makes the presentation with the motive of getting a promotion. Another scenario could be that she makes the presentation with the motive of increasing the sales of the corporation so that it benefits all the stakeholders. In the first case, the action binds her. In the second case, it doesn\u2019t.   Alternatively, consider a musician performing on stage. If he performs with the sole motive to get applause and get nominated for an award, the action will bind him. But if he performs with the sole motive of entertaining the audience and honouring his craft, the action will not bind him.   Shri Krishna gently reveals the technique of cutting off these bindings in the rest of the chapter."

In essence, Shri Krishna instructed Arjuna to maintain equanimity, an \u201ceven keel\u201d attitude, not just in war, but in any circumstance in life.   Let us take stock of where we are. We had seen that Shri Krishna was covering 4 main topics: 1) Informing Arjuna that his logic and reasoning was incorrect 2) Explaining the correct logic and reasoning to Arjuna 3) Providing practical guidance to implement this correct logic and reasoning 4) Describing the attributes of the individual who follows this teaching. We are currently in the set of shlokas covering topic 2 \u2013 the correct reasoning and logic.   After the first sub-topic of the eternal essence concluded, we explored the second sub-topic of svadharma. Shri Krishna is now about to conclude this sub-topic by pointing us to the ultimate goal of our spiritual efforts.   Having reoriented ourselves with the scheme of the second chapter, lets now examine the current shloka. On first glance, the lesson in this shloka seems unapproachable and impossible to carry out, to some extent.   We encounter joy, sorrow, victory, defeat, gain and loss almost everyday, even several times a day. And each time we encounter any of these situations, we get emotionally and sometimes even physically affected by them. At work, a meeting with your boss does not go well. But on another day, your boss gives you an exemplary speech on a project well executed. How can we possible treat these as equal?   Shri Krishna fully understands this point. Here, he only lays out the ultimate goal for us: the goal of equanimity, or treating each and every life situation equally without getting agitated. Now that we know what the goal is, he will gently guide us through a path of practical advice throughout the rest of the teaching in the Gita.   So as we read the rest of the second chapter, if we think we have lost sight of the goal, let\u2019s remember this shloka."

This time, however, the message is more specific \u2013 Shri Krishna does not want Arjuna to resort to inaction or stasis.   Here Shri Krishna is saying : \u201cArjuna, regardless of whether you win or lose, the outcome will always be favourable. But the longer you keep pondering over your fight or not-to-fight dilemma, the further you move away from action towards inaction. Under no circumstances is inaction permissible. Therefore, fight!\u201d   When faced with tough situations, our natural instinct is to move away from action towards inaction. There is always a hesitation, sometimes procrastination. And usually, this hesitation is caused by a fear of failure, or fear of trying something that we have not done before.   But Shri Krishna advises us that as long as we are performing actions that are aligned to our svadharma, our duty, action is always preferable to inaction or procrastination. The outcome of performing an action in accordance with our duty will always be favourable.   Footnotes   1. In common usage, Dharma means religion, so sva-dharma could mean \u201cone\u2019s religion\u201d. And so, this verse has the potential to be translated as \u201ceveryone should fight a war for one\u2019s religion\u201d. This is a misinterpretation. If one really is a warrior (in the army, navy etc.) then they should definitely fight for their country. But if one is not a warrior by profession, there is no need to fight."

After having using logic in his teaching, Shri Krishna uses a call to emotion as a tool of persuasion.   For a great warrior like Arjuna, reputation was everything. Therefore, Shri Krishna advised Arjuna to remember his svadharma, his duty and fight, or else he would lose his reputation as a mighty warrior.   We can learn so much from the way Shri Krishna builds and delivers his arguments to Arjuna, not just from the teaching itself. Whenever we have to make a presentation at work, or want to convince our spouse or our parents of something that is important to us, it is always better to a mix of logic and emotion in our arguments rather than just chose one or the other."

Let us understand the meaning used here. If you live in society anywhere, in a city, town, village etc. you are always bound by certain laws. If you conduct an act that goes against the law, then it is called a crime. Stealing a car, for example, is a crime.   Similarly, if someone does not perform their svadharma or duty, or does something counter to their svadharma, it is equivalent to a crime under a cosmic or universal law. That crime is termed as a sin.   Therefore, Shri Krishna urges Arjuna and us to consider the repercussions of not conducting our svadharma. Like a good teacher, he had explained the benefits of the teaching earlier, and now he elaborates on the downside of not following the teaching in this and the next shloka."

In other words, a person performing his or her svadharma would always prefer working hard towards a challenging assignment rather than simply pulling along in a mediocre one. Shri Krishna pointed this out to Arjuna by reminding him that a true warrior would look forward to the challenge of fighting the Kaurava army, which was filled with world-renowned warriors.   How is this relevant to us? Our work should give us joy, our work should be its own reward. If we have chosen a profession that feels like drudgery, if we feel that any new work given to us is a chore rather than a challenge, if all we can do is complain, then we should re-examine whether we are really following our svadharma, or we are qualified to do something else."

He deals with the issue of svadharma, or one\u2019s own duty. It is important to remember that although Shri Krishna has addressed these shlokas to a mighty warrior, each of us has to interpret what they mean for us.   So, what exactly is one\u2019s duty? In this context, it is not something we have to do because someone else is forcing us, or because the so-called caste system says so.   Duty is work that one enjoys doing, has the aptitude and training for doing, and is not illegal or unethical. The practice of medicine becomes a svadharma for a doctor when he or she finds joy in the work, has completed medical training, and uses it for the betterment of society. Education becomes svadharma for students when they find joy in attending classes and studying for exams.   Note that the same person could have more than one svadharma. For example, a woman could be a mother at home, and executive at work.   One may ask, \u201cI have the training and aptitude for my profession. I certainly do not perform any         illegal activities. But I don\u2019t find joy in my work. It is a drudgery for me, I only do it so that I can earn a living. How do I find joy in my work?\u201d. Shri Krishna has anticipated this question and will give us the trick for addressing this question very soon.   Let\u2019s also understand why Shri Krishna chose to introduce the topic of svadharma right after concluding the topic of the eternal essence. As we saw earlier, most of us are not at the advanced stage of spirituality where we have the ability to perceive the eternal essence in all beings, even though we may have an abstract or theoretical understanding of it by now. We are people with professions, jobs, careers and responsibilities. We are not in a position to retire to a monastery. Most of our day is spent in work.   Knowing this, Shri Krishna is gently introducing us to a more practical method of accessing the eternal essence. In this method, we can continue to lead our daily lives and still orient ourselves to accessing that eternal essence. As a side effect of this, we will also find joy and fulfillment in our work."

Now, having followed the teaching so far, we would probably have some questions. Let\u2019s try to address some of them.   So if we were to ask ourselves \u201cI have studied the Gita for a while now, what is the message in a nutshell so far?\u201d. Or in management-speak \u201cWhat is the net-net?\u201d. It is this shloka. Therefore, even if we may not remember all the shlokas about the eternal essence, we should not forget this shloka.   Here\u2019s another question: \u201cWe have covered the entire first chapter, as well as some part of the second chapter. Where is God in all of this?\u201d We have purposely avoided the word \u201cGod\u201d in our discussions because Shri Krishna has not yet uttered that word in any teaching so far. As we proceed through the Gita, Shri Krishna will bring up this topic at the appropriate time. For now, if we go to a place of worship like a temple, we can still continue to pray to God, knowing that the eternal essence is an integral part of God as well.   The pragmatist among us would ask \u201cAll this abstract stuff is well and good, how do we apply it in our daily life?\u201d. And the answer is \u2013 stay tuned! The topics will become more practical starting with the next shloka. All we need to remember is the examples from these shlokas: the eternal essence is like the sun, actionless and changeless.

Therefore, he wanted to remind Arjuna about it, and also instill a sense of deep curiosity and interest in him. In this shloka, Shri Krishna did both of those things.   Four types of spiritual seekers are pointed out here. Firstly, there are seekers who have heard about the eternal essence through the Gita or through other means. Usually, most of them will hear about it and forget about it. But there will be some that will become interested in it, and will want to hear more \u2013 this is the second category. Of those seekers, some will try to gain an intellectual understanding about it and having done so, will be so enthralled with it that they will keep speaking about it to other people. This is the third category.   But the most devoted and advanced seekers will ultimately perceive the eternal essence directly, and the perception would have occurred without any sense organs. When this happens, there would be no words to describe it. The closest one could come to describing it is when we see something so wonderful that it renders us speechless, like a breathtaking painting or a waterfall.

Let\u2019s try to understand it to the best of our ability. Let us look at some examples.   The first example, which is an oft-quoted one, is the seed example. We know that we can hold the seed of a tree, say a mango tree, in the palm of our hand \u2013 it is that small. We also know that if we provide the seed with the right climate, soil, water and fertilizer, it will grow into a tall mango tree. The blueprint of the tall tree is present in that small little seed. In other words, the mango tree is latent until the seed is planted. In time, when the seed transforms into a sapling, and then into a tree, we can say that the tree has manifested out of the seed. And in the due course of time, the tree will eventually transform into wood or paper for human consumption, or get burnt and become one with the soil, or something else.   Today is the festival of Diwali when I\u2019m writing this, so I have to add the example of the flowerpot firecracker. For those unfamiliar with it, the flowerpot firecracker is a fist-sized conical shape with a wick on top. After the wick is lit, the firecracker shoots up a dazzling fireworks display in the shape of a fountain, sometimes up to 100 feet tall. This display lasts for about 30-60 seconds. Here we can say that the fireworks display was latent in the firecracker, it came into existence when the wick was lit, and it ended when the gunpowder was exhausted and eventually absorbed in the air. To make it even more relevant, sometimes a hundred or so of these flowerpots are lit in succession, so that as one ends, another one begins.   Finally, here\u2019s a somewhat different example. I used to play Beatles songs in a band. We would rehearse most of the Beatles popular songs beforehand. When we began our performance in the club, we would ask the audience to request a song, which we would end up performing. Therefore, the song was latent in our memory, it would come into existence when we played it, and it would end soon thereafter, after having travelled into the listener\u2019s ears, and hopefully into their minds. Also, each time we played it, it would sound just a little different.   What\u2019s common in all the 3 examples? In each case there was a beginning where something was hidden or latent, then something happened that caused it to come into existence, and eventually there came a time when that thing no longer existed. In effect, the birth, existence and death of a tree is no different than the \u201cbirth\u201d, \u201cexistence\u201d and \u201cdeath\u201d of the fireworks display or the song. Birth, existence and death are modifications rather than standalone events, therefore one should not grieve when someone or something comes to an end. It just transforms into something else."

He continues the argument in this shloka.   The notion that birth eventually results in death, and death eventually results in birth is sometimes difficult for us to accept emotionally, but at the intellectual level, most of us acknowledge and accept it. I remember watching a TV show that showed a time lapse (high speed) video of a rodent\u2019s corpse decaying into the soil, and small plants and flowers emerging from the soil shortly thereafter. I thought that it very vividly and visually illustrated the cyclical nature of birth and death.   If we look at this example closely, we conclude that the physical body of the animal transformed into the raw material for the body of the flowers and plants. And although we could not see it, we can guess that the eternal essence of the animal \u201cdied\u201d and is now \u201cborn\u201d as the life force that sustains the plants and flowers.   Therefore we would not grieve for death the animal\u2019s body, nor for the death of the life force in it, because both were born again after they died.

Now, the teaching becomes slightly less abstract and a little more \u201cdown-to-earth\u201d as it were.

Our mind will find a hard time comprehending that something was never born/created, and something will never die/get destroyed.   For example, we may think of the Earth as relatively imperishable, but even then we know from our school geology class that it was formed billions of years ago out of cooling of gases.

In the next few shlokas, Sri Krishna will convince Arjuna that his grief is unfounded even if he accepts that the eternal essence undergoes birth and death.   We may have a question here: Why did Shri Krishna begin his teaching of the Gita by describing the eternal essence? Isn\u2019t it a complex, abstract topic that all of us, including Arjuna, would have a hard time understanding? Couldn\u2019t he have started with something simpler?   Here\u2019s a possible answer. What is described as the eternal essence is the goal, the final result of the Gita teaching. Like a good teacher, Shri Krishna described the end goal to his students before describing the means to attain that goal. Any good teacher will always describe, elaborate upon, and glorify the end goal in the first lecture of a course. This will generate interest, curiosity, focus and dedication from the student. The student may not necessarily understand everything about that goal, but that is ok."

In the second chapter, Shri Krishna covers 4 main topics: 1) Informing Arjuna that his logic and reasoning was incorrect 2) Explaining the correct logic and reasoning to Arjuna 3) Providing practical guidance to implement this correct logic and reasoning 4) Describing the attributes of a person who follows this teaching.   We are still exploring the second topic, and this shloka marks the end of the argument that Shri Krishna began in shloka 17. The argument was whether the eternal essence can slay or be slain. Shri Krishna, in this shloka, concludes the argument by saying the following:   \u201cArjuna, associate yourself with the eternal essence and not the body. The eternal essence is eternal and imperishable; it cannot slay or be slain. Therefore do not grieve for the opposing army\u2019s warriors on their imminent death. Their bodies will perish anyway, so you shouldn\u2019t grieve for what is bound to perish. The eternal essence which is common between them and you is imperishable, so you should not grieve for that either. Therefore you have no reason to grieve at all.\u201d   Let\u2019s look further. If something is imperceptible, that means it is beyond the realm of our sense organs. If something is incomprehensible, it is beyond the realm of the intellect. If something is unchanging, then no physical effort will have an impact on it. We are dealing with something that is not of this material world, it is beyond it.   In the next few shlokas, Shri Krishna provides a simpler alternative of logic and reason to Arjuna, after which the teaching takes a turn towards more practical and concrete topics."

By now, it must be clear to us that the topic of the eternal essence is abstract, and our intellect will have difficulty in grasping it. This is perfectly normal, because the eternal essence cannot be fully comprehended by the intellect. But we can get close to it through negation.   What does negation mean? Let\u2019s say you want your friend to buy a shirt for you from the store. You will inform your friend about that the shirt is fuchsia color. If you were to use negation, you would say that the shirt is not regular pink, not dark pink, not fully bright pink etc.   Similarly, the eternal essence here is indicated by negation, that it cannot be cut, cannot be wetted or dried etc.   Shri Krishna will provide us with a few more shlokas about the eternal essence, after which the topic will change to something much more tangible and concrete.

For our purposes, the main point here is that the eternal essence, or the body dweller, is separate from the human body. When the human body has outlived its purpose, the body dweller discards it and subsequently inherits a new body.   If we have followed the line of reasoning so far, a doubt emerges. How does the eternal essence, which is all-pervading and infinite, enter and leave human bodies? Shouldn\u2019t there just be one eternal essence, one body dweller? This question will be answered later in subsequent verses. For now, we should still consider the eternal essence as one but know that the one eternal essence gets attached to this body or that body, and perceives itself to be that body out of an error.

It empowers material objects to act without actually acting. Therefore a wise person will never think that the eternal essence can slay or kill or act at all. It is like the sun.   The refrain is clear: \u201cYou are the eternal essence \u2013 birthless, changeless, eternal and imperishable. The eternal essence does not slay, nor does it get slain.\u201d It is repeated throughout the Gita because it will take a significant effort on our part to truly understand and internalize this message."

Any material object, including the human body, goes through six types of modifications: birth, exist, change, grow, decay, and to perish. The eternal essence is beyond all these modifications, hence it is changeless.   Two additional qualities of the eternal essence are provided here. The first is that it is birthless. It is logical that it should be birthless, otherwise it could not be eternal and timeless. And since it is birthless, it would have always existed, therefore it is primeval.

Here Shri Krishna addresses another concern that Arjuna had raised. Arjuna thought that that he will be held responsible for killing his kinsmen, which was something that was abhorrent to him. But Shri Krishna through this shloka advised him to use the logic or the perspective of the eternal essence. The eternal essence does not kill, nor does it die from someone else trying to kill it.   But how does this apply to us? We are not warriors, and it is rare that we will be put in the position of killing somebody. So there must be another interpretation.This shloka equates the act of slaying to performance of any action, and being slain to any change or modification. In other words, the eternal essence never performs any action, nor does it undergo any change or modification.   As an example, let\u2019s consider at the sun. Without the sun there will be no activity or life on this planet. There would be no plant life because plants use the sun\u2019s energy. There would be no animal or human life because both cannot survive without plants. But, does the sun perform any action pertaining to growing a plant or an animal? Does it get affected by all the changes happening on earth? It does not that that \u201cI caused this forest to grow\u201d or \u201cI was impacted by this eclipse\u201d. It remains actionless and changeless.   The shloka goes on to say that one who thinks that the eternal essence acts or kills is not using viveka or discrimination, and that person does not have the correct understanding. The person is still thinking at the level of the material object, or in other words, the level of the un-real, and has still not learnt to discriminate between the two.   Footnotes   1.

It is unfathomable, incomprehensible. In other words, it cannot be understood by our intellect like we understand other kinds of knowledge. Also notice here that the eternal essence is denoted as one entity, whereas the bodies are many. Which means it is same eternal essence that pervades all material objects, including human bodies.   Since Shri Krishna concludes a line of reasoning in this shloka with the word \u201ctasmaat\u201d, let\u2019s summarize the argument that began in verse 11 of this chapter:   1) Shri Krishna told Arjuna : \u201cYou are thinking that it is evil, wrong, unlawful to fight against your kinsmen. Your logic is incorrect. You are missing the big picture.\u201d   2) \u201cI will tell you the correct logic. You shouldn\u2019t grieve for them. The eternal essence, body dweller, is imperishable and real, whereas human bodies and material objects are perishable, and are unreal, as it were.\u201d   3) \u201cI will also give you some practical advice. Do not get agitated by joy and sorrow caused by contact with people, objects and situations. These are temporary conditions so bear them patiently. Once you learn to remain stable through joy and sorrow, you will begin to realize the eternal essence\u201d.   4) \u201cNow that you know that you can never destroy the imperishable eternal essence, and that you should not grieve for the perishable, get up and fight, O Arjuna\u201d.   So then, what is the bottomline? \u201cArjuna, you should not think that you are this human body. Associate yourself with that body-dweller, that eternal essence. It will never get destroyed, so there is no need for grief.\u201d   Here we also see that Shri Krishna, like any good teacher, is providing 2 kinds of training : theoretical and practical. From the next shloka onwards, we will examine the theoretical, or logical aspect. In the later part of the chapter we will look at the practical aspect.   Footnotes   1. This shloka gives a pointer to the birth of the ego. When the eternal essence, which is one entity, associates itself with material objects, it gets split or fragmented. It begins to think that it is limited by whatever material object it is associated with. And when that eternal essence feels limited to a particular human body, and does everything in its power to maintain a sense of separation from everything else, that gives rise to the sense of ego."

This verse gives us two qualities that the eternal essence possesses. Note that the sanskrit word \u201ctat\u201d meaning \u201cthat\u201d refers to the eternal essence in this shloka.   Firstly, the eternal essence is imperishable. It cannot be destroyed, nor is it created. In the bangle example from the prior verse, the pawn shop owner only cared about the gold content of the bangle and not its shape and form. He could melt that bangle into another ornament, melt it again and make it into another ornament, and so on. In doing so, each subsequent ornament was \u201ccreated\u201d and \u201cdestroyed\u201d, but the gold essence was imperishable and indestructible. Similarly, the eternal essence spoken of in these verses is imperishable.   Secondly, the eternal essence pervades \u201call this\u201d, which means the eternal essence pervades the entire universe. If we immerse a piece of cloth into water, water pervades each and every fibre of the cloth. There is no part of the cloth that isn\u2019t dry. In the same way, from a rock, to plants, to animals, and to humans, the eternal essence pervades everything that is part of the universe."

It begins to lead us into understanding this thing called the eternal essence, and how we can experience it. At present, we may not have the capability to go too deep into it, but we can try to get its gist.   The best example I heard in connection with this verse is the animal cookie example. We may have come across animal cookies. They are a brand of children\u2019s cookies shaped like tigers, elephant etc. Now, some children will only want to eat the tiger shaped cookie and not the others, whereas other children may only want to eat the elephant shaped ones and not the others. But, most adults would not care about the shape of the cookie, they will eat any shape.   Why is this so? The adult has the wisdom to go straight to the essence of the cookie. He or she does not care about the name or the form taken by the cookie. And this wisdom has come by maturity, by knowing that the animals were \u201cun-real\u201d and they did not have \u201cexistence\u201d. Only the cookie dough was \u201creal\u201d, just like this verse indicates.   Another example is about the newly married wife who has just received a beautiful gold bangle from her husband. Although she cares about the shape and ornamentation of the bangle, a pawn shop owner would not not really care about those things. He only cares about the weight of the bangle.   The prior verse indicated that a wise person is one who stays balanced in joy and sorrow. This verse explains that the balanced person will slowly achieve wisdom and reach a state where any object or situation will begin to lose its \u201creal-ness\u201d. Only the eternal essence will remain as the common element behind every object or situation. This vision is called \u201ctattva-drishti\u201d or \u201cvision of the essence\u201d.   Moreover, the word \u201cbhaava\u201d has another meaning: finitude. So it means that the real is infinite, and the unreal is finite. Therefore, the wise person does not go on chasing material objects that have a finite existence and give only finite happiness.   Footnotes   1. The Jnyaneshwari has several examples to illustrate this verse, for further reference."

Immortality here does not refer to a state where our body never perishes, or a state where we go to heaven and enjoy its delights forever.   What is meant here is that life is a series of experiences that arise, exist temporarily, and perish. The person who knows the \u201ctrick\u201d of staying balanced through these experiences will attain a state where they will transcend the push and pull of these experiences, and will eventually get to touch that changeless, eternal essence that came up in the earlier verses. One who does not get affected by agitation is called \u201cdheera\u201d.   So how do we bring this down to our daily lives? Let\u2019s first look at a simple question. Why do someone else\u2019s agitations do not impact us? Because we do not associate our \u201cI\u201d with someone else\u2019s agitations. Similarly, our \u201cI\u201d is also not associated with our body/mind/intellect related agitations and conditions. If there is a fragrance in the room, we do not say \u201cI am fragrant\u201d. Therefore, we should strive to keep the joyful or sorrowful condition from associating with the \u201cI\u201d. Instead of saying \u201cI am sad\u201d, we can say, \u201cthere is sadness\u201d.   Furthermore, we have seen instances where people are ready to endure pain and sorrow when they attach themselves to a higher ideal. A parent will endure a lot of suffering so that he or she can educate the child. A freedom fighter will endure torture, or even die for the cause of the country\u2019s freedom. This verse is asking us to become wise and aim for the highest possible ideal, that of the eternal essence.   We have been repeatedly hearing about the eternal essence in these verses. Can we get a deeper understanding?   Footnotes   1. The examples in this post are from Swami Chinmayananda\u2019s commentary on the Gita   2. The word \u201csama\u201d contains the word \u201cmaa\u201d meaning mother. The mother\u2019s loving attitude towards her child is same regardless of how the child behaves or misbehaves. Her attitude is \u201csama\u201d or even-keel."

But since none of us have ever seen it, or experienced it, we would now like to know how can we make that happen. This verse gives us a preparatory step in that regard. It advises us to develop the capability of titiskha, or brave endurance against joy and sorrow.   Let\u2019s examine each aspect of this verse. The first part of this verse makes the assertion that contact with material objects, or more specifically, contact of our senses with material objects, causes us to experience heat and cold.   How does this work? The senses react to external stimuli and send an input signal to the mind. The mind processes these sensory inputs and labels some as \u201c joy\u201d and some as \u201csorrow\u201d.         A hot coffee when it is freezing weather outside gives us joy, for sure. But the same cup of hot coffee in boiling hot summer will probably not give us joy, in fact it would probably give us sorrow.   More broadly, heat and cold in this verse represent polar opposites of stimuli received by all of our sense organs. If we take the organ of sight, then heat and cold represent beauty and ugliness. If we take the organ of touch, then heat and cold represent soft and hard.   Taking this even further, we can include words as well. If someone praises us, our ego-centred mind gets a boost, and we experience pleasure at that point. But if someone insults us, or criticizes us, our ego-centered mind feels threatened and we experience sorrow at that point.   So to summarize, our sense organs and our ego can get affected by external stimuli. But, instead of labelling each external stimulus as joy or sorrow, what if we remained steady through each of them? Instead of labelling these stimuli as \u201cjoy\u201d and \u201csorrow\u201d, could we begin to label them differently?   Let\u2019s say your boss gave you a mouthful of criticism after your sales presentation at work. His words came through your ears, the ears sent a signal to your mind, and the mind took this criticism and labelled it as \u201csorrowful\u201d or \u201cpainful\u201d. Instead, what would happen if we labelled this as something neutral e.g. \u201cuseful information\u201d, and used it to improve our next presentation? And if the words were not really criticism, but were veiled or direct insults, what would happen if we labelled them as \u201cirrelevant\u201d or \u201cnoise\u201d or \u201cchatter\u201d?   Now you may say, yes, that sounds good in theory, but how do we do it in practice? The second part of the verse gives a clue in this regard. It says that any contact with material objects is temporary, it will appear and then disappear, and it has a beginning and an end. Therefore, if we know that something has an end, why should we let it bother us? Or conversely, if we know that a pleasant situation has ended, if the child\u2019s bubble has burst, why should we grieve about it?   Again, you may say that developing this titiksha, this brave endurance, would still be difficult. Just like losing weight is not something that happens overnight, developing titiksha will also not happen overnight. You need to follow a structured, disciplined technique to do so, and the Gita will go into this topic in depth.   So then, what is the benefit of developing this titiksha? We shall see very soon."

        "content": "dehinosminyathaa dehe kaumaram yauvanam jaraa |   tathaa dehaantarapraaptirdheerastatra na muhyati || 13 ||   Just as in this body, the body dweller passes through childhood, youth and old age, so also does it obtain another body (after death); the steadfast person does not grieve over this.   dehinaha : body dweller   asmin : this   yathaa : just like   dehe : body   kaumaram : childhood   yauvanam : youth   jaraa: old age   tathaa : similarly   dehaaantara : another   praaptihi: obtain   dheeraha : steadfast person   tatra : by that   na muhyati : do not grieve   It is our experience that we pass through childhood, youth and old age. We can agree that this concept is familiar to us. But note the language used in the first line. It is not you or I that passes through these phases, it is something called the \u201cdehina\u201d or the \u201cbody dweller\u201d. The body is born, it undergoes changes, and eventually perishes. But the body dweller remains constant through these changes. So, this means that the body dweller is something that is separate, distinct and different from the body.   Remember the example of Mr. X and his car from the first verse? Let\u2019s revisit it. Mr. X is excited when his car is brand new. After 5-6 years, it starts to develop engine problems. After another 4-5 years, the problems have become so bad that Mr. X decides to sell this car and buy a new Mercedes S-class. Mr. X can be called a \u201ccar dweller\u201d.   As the old car\u2019s engine degraded over the years, Mr. X remained the same from the car\u2019s perspective. But when the car had lived its life, he discarded that car for another new car. And there was nothing to be sad about this point. An extreme scenario is some unscrupulous people deliberately crash their old car just so that they can get insurance money to buy a new one.   Similarly, our body undergoes modifications of birth and aging, and eventually perishes. But the body dweller remains constant through these modifications. When the old body has become unfit to dwell in, the body dweller discards it and obtains a new body. The key point here is that the body dweller remains constant through the changes in its body, and also through the change from one body to another. And just like in the car example, a wise person should not grieve about growing old or dying, because the body dweller will always remain constant.   The body dweller is, therefore, the eternal essence that was highlighted in the prior verse. And since it is different than the physical body which perishes, it cannot be \u201cfound\u201d in any part of the physical body.   So what exactly is this body dweller, this eternal essence? And how should we acquire the wisdom to see this eternal essence?   Footnotes   1. In one day we have several thoughts such as \u201cI am happy\u201d, \u201cI am sad\u201d, we join a condition to our \u201cI\u201d. Each time do so, we are \u201cborn\u201d as a happy person, as a sad person and so on, even if there is no new physical body that is born."

If you cancel the double negatives, a simpler version of this verse will be        \u201cAll of us are timeless and eternal. We always existed in the past, and we will always exist in the future\u201d.   This statement, at first glance, does not seem to make sense. So let\u2019s look at an example. Let\u2019s imagine a huge lake with deep waters. The surface of the lake is usually quiet. Once in a while, a wind blows across the lake causing a wave to appear for a few seconds, then disappear soon after.   If we apply the logic of this verse and examine it from the perspective of a wave, the lake always        existed before the wave came into existence. And the lake will remain long after any wave has disappeared.   Similarly, an LCD television has thousands of pixels, or dots of light, on its screen. These pixels turn on and off, due to which a moving image is created on the screen. We can enjoy a movie on the screen that will begin and end, characters and situations will come and go, but the screen will remain as a constant.   Now, according to physics, matter can never be created or destroyed, it can only undergo change from one state to another. So therefore, this shloka reiterates this physical law by saying that the atoms and molecules that comprise us always existed in the universe in some shape or forms.   But, just like the surface of the lake is a constant that lets the play of waves happen on it, there is a timeless, eternal, constant surface or \u201cessence\u201d that is present in the entire universe, which is the backdrop on which the play of matter happens.   At this point, what is being spoken of here may seem abstract and somewhat hard to conceptualize, but it is similar to algebra where we denote unknown quantities by variables like x and y, till such time as we deduce the right value.   Ok. So what exactly is this eternal essence? How do we see it? If it is present in us, which part of the body does it reside in?   Footnotes   1. The wave and lake example is from the Jnyaneshwari, which is filled with tons of examples to explain complex concepts such as this one."

        "content": "Shri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:   ashochyaananvashochastvam pragnyaavaadaamshcha bhaashase |   gataasoonagataasoonshcha naanushochanti panditaaha || 11 ||   Shri Bhagavaan said:   You are grieving for those who are not worthy of sorrow, yet seemingly speaking words of wisdom. The wise grieve not for the departed, nor for those who have not yet departed.   ashochyaan : not worthy of sorrow   anvashochaha : grieving   tvam : you are   pragnyaa : wisdom   vaadaam : words   cha : yet seemingly   bhaashase : speak   gataasoon : departed   agataasoon : undeparted   cha : and   na : do not   anushochanti : grieve   panditaaha : wise people   In the verses so far, Arjuna thought he was wise in lamenting the war by making a plea for peace. But Shri Krishna here pointed out that Arjuna \u201cseemingly spoke wise words\u201d, i.e. in reality what Arjuna said was not correct. His assessment of the situation was clouded by emotion instead of being driven by logic and reason. On one hand, he was displaying grief, on the other hand, he was trying to display logic. Logic and grief cannot go together.   There are several instances in life where what we thought was correct knowledge, no longer applies. For example, let\u2019s say you get promoted to your first managerial job. It is your first day at work and you get invited to 10 meetings from different teams. If you were at a job right out of college, you would ensure that you attended all the meetings that you were invited to, and doing so would be the right thing to do at that stage in your career. But as a manager, you have the advantage of seniority to choose which meetings to go to, and which to avoid. You no longer assess the situation like you previously used to. You use different reasoning and logic.   Shri Krishna\u2019s wanted to correct Arjuna\u2019s logic. He pointed to Arjuna that there was no need to grieve for the living nor for the dead. Death is inevitable. We should enjoy and appreciate the living, just like one appreciates a colourful soap bubble blown by a child. The bubble will last for a few seconds, but inevitably, it will burst. Some bubbles burst quickly, some last for a longer time. But there is never a surprise when a bubble eventually bursts.   Therefore Shri Krishna instructs Arjuna, and us, to assess any life situation with logic and reason, and not to get swayed by emotion. Of course, it will not always be possible to check our emotions, but it should be what we strive for constantly. We saw what happened to Arjuna when he let his emotions run wild, resulting in a panic attack. A wise person who uses \u201cviveka\u201d or discrimination (logic and reasoning about correct and incorrect) is called a \u201cpandit\u201d. He need not necessarily have formal degrees, but is one who uses reason all the time.   A bubble will eventually burst, and the body will eventually perish. But is that the end? The next verse goes deeper into this topic.   Footnotes   1. \u201cMoha\u201d is delusion is reverse thinking. Mistaking the real for the unreal, impermanent as permanent, something that was never ours as ours, is delusion. The first line of the shloka addresses moha.   2. \u201cShoka\u201d or grief is excessive dwelling in the past, or in other words, reliving past memories repeatedly. The second line of the shloka addresses shoka.   3. Per Shankaracharya\u2019s commentary, shoka and moha were the two primary reasons that Arjuna resisted fighting against his relatives."

The commonly held notion is : Shri Krishna wanted to use Arjuna as a vehicle for delivering the sermon of the Gita, and he smiled because the time for delivering the sermon had come as soon as Arjuna requested him to become his disciple. Another interpretation is that on the one hand, Arjuna is surrendering to Shri Krishna and asking for guidance, but o the other hand he says that he will not fight. Therefore Shri Krishna is smiling on this qualified request from Arjuna.   Our journey so far was just the background of the Gita. Starting from the next verse, we are about to delve into the heart of the Gita. Like any good speaker, Shri Krishna has provided an overview of the Gita for us in Chapter 2. Later chapters will delve into these themes in significant detail.   We will try our best to understand some of the more abstract verses in this chapter, but let\u2019s not worry if we don\u2019t understand them completely in the first reading. These verses will reveal new nuances and facets in each reading."

Arjuna knew that he was in no shape to make that decision himself, let alone fight. So he eventually proclaimed that he would not fight, and became silent.   We should note that it was not just Arjuna\u2019s voice that became silent. His mind, though not totally silent, became calmer than what it was in the last verse. Otherwise, it could not have assimilated the teaching that was about to follow.   Also note that the narration has shifted back to Sanjaya in this verse, and the meter has changed back to normal.

It burrowed deep into his personality and lodged itself in it. This deep rooted sorrow had the effect of totally throwing his senses off track. He was not able to see or hear clearly. This sorrow was not going to be easy to remove.   In this verse, Arjuna also came to the conclusion that what he was looking for could not be found in the material world. If this were the case, he would have been happy with wealth, riches and thrones. But here we see that even supremacy over the gods was something that would not satisfy him.   Arjuna reached a point where the only thing that mattered for him was the ultimate cure for sorrow, a cure that was permanent, and not some material thing like wealth that would diminish sorrow temporarily. And this ultimate cure that he was seeking was a higher level of discrimination or viveka that would lead him to liberation."

Arjuna finally gained enough of his reasoning capacity back to realize that his mind had been thrown off balance by cowardice, which he rightly labelled as an error. In the first chapter, he could never have come to this conclusion because he was experiencing an extremely negative emotional state. He was able to put a degree of objectivity towards his thinking, some space between his thoughts and himself. And in doing so, he realized that his intellect was totally deluded.   In addition, he also realized that because of this cowardice, he was in no position to make a decision about whether to fight or not. This was a high-stakes decision, a decision that could impact the course of history. He quickly needed to find some other way of coming to a decision. The only way he could do so is to give up any pretense of knowing what was the correct thing to do, and give that decision to a trusted friend and guide, Shri Krishna.   For many of us, especially in youth, we never feel the need to look beyond the material world. All our goals and aspirations are material, and once we achieve a certain goal, we strive for a higher goal. And as long as everything goes our way, we are fine. But sooner or later, something happens in our lives that shakes things up and makes us think whether we are missing something. We all have to pass through a earth-shattering stage in life that makes us question things, and makes us revisit our assumptions and beliefs. That stage was indicated in chapter 1 of the Gita, when Arjuna saw his entire world and belief system collapse.   When this shattering happens, we have two choices. We can continue operating in the material world in the same way as we did before. We can also use this collapse to search for something higher. The choice made by a seeker is indicated by the words \u201cTell me what is definitely appropriate. Guide me, I am your disciple and take refuge in you\u201d uttered by Arjuna."

His hardline position morphed into a dilemma. And the dilemma was as follows: \u201cShould I or should I not fight? I do not know which is correct.\u201d This question is the fundamental question that provoked the message of the Gita that we shall see very shortly.   We face questions like this all the time \u2013 this was alluded to in an earlier post. A boss may like an employee, but the business will tank if he does not fire the employee. Should he fire him or not? Questions like this arise all the time. Life is nothing but a series of actions driven by the day-to-day decisions we take.   Here\u2019s another important point. Arjuna\u2019s teachers and elders were revered and respected by him, they gave him pleasure, but here they were in front of him, ready to kill him. Similarly, behind every pleasure-filled person, experience or object we encounter in life lies its negative aspect. This is an interesting insight about life. It is rare to find people, experiences or objects that give us pleasure all of the time.         Here\u2019s an example that resonates with us: a new house that was a source of joy in the beginning, will cause grief when one has to pay for its maintenance."

Arjuna\u2019s panic attack has ended, and his emotional state has become somewhat normal. The change in Arjuna\u2019s attitude is also indicated by the change in meter \u2013 we notice that this shloka, and some of the forthcoming shlokas, have a longer meter.   What remains, though, is a tinge of the victim attitude, indicated in the statement that he would prefer begging to hurting his teachers. But what is positive here is that Arjuna is slowly opening up to logical reasoning, since he is no longer under the influence of the panic attack, and his agitations have subsided.   The lesson here is that we cannot have a sane conversation with someone in a charged emotional state, their mind has to calm down somewhat in order to create room for logic.   In this shloka, Arjuna is still holding on to the position that he will definitely not kill his kinsmen. But as his emotional state calms down, we shall see him begin to question that position."

Since Arjuna\u2019s arguments from the previous chapter remained unanswered, hence he continued to insist on relinquishing the war.   Arjuna uses the words \u201cslayer of the demon Madhu\u201d and \u201cslayer of foes\u201d to address Shri Krishna, hinting that it is easy to slay evil individuals but difficult to slay one\u2019s kinsmen. The fundamental problem still remained unsolved, which is that Arjuna was still holding on to the familial and teacher-student relationships in the context of a battlefield. But on the Kaurava side, Bheeshma and Drona viewed Arjuna as an enemy and not as a student or a family member. They were not under any delusion like Arjuna was.   Can we relate this to an example from our lives? Think of a father and mother who have brought up their children, and like any responsible parents, guided them as to what was right and what was wrong. When the children grow into adults, they now possess the ability to think for themselves, and on occasion will consult their parents on decisions that they need help with.   But, similar to Arjuna\u2019s attachment to his elders, if the parents still hold on to the relationship that existed when their children were young, the children would not consider that to be appropriate behaviour and then this could impact the relationship with their parents."

Let\u2019s first look at the stick or negative aspect, followed by the carrot or positive aspect.   One of the worst things you can call a warrior is effeminate. Even young boys playing sports will get upset when someone says \u2018Hey! You throw the ball like a girl!\u201d. So imagine how Arjuna felt when Shri Krishna called him effeminate. Moreover, using the adjective weak-hearted to describe Arjuna was another jolt to the usually courageous and lion-hearted warrior.   But Shri Krishna also appealed to Arjuna\u2019s better qualities. By addressing him as \u201cPaartha\u201d, he reminded Arjuna of his esteemed and respected mother Prithaa (Kunti), and how she would feel if Arjuna shirked away from war. Shri Krishna also reminded Arjuna of his battle prowess, that he was called a \u201cscorcher of foes\u201d.   The final point in this shloka is the powerful Sanskrit word \u201cutthishta\u201d, meaning arise, which evokes Swami Vivekananda\u2019s famous statement \u201cArise! Awake! and stop not till the goal is reached!\u2019. Arjuna is instructed not just to arise physically, but also to lift his mind from the depths of delusion to a higher plane of intelligence."

But what he said was not what Arjuna expected at all.   Let\u2019s look at the kind of words Shri Krishna used.         They were not words of kindness. They were not words of sympathy or support. They were tough, provocative words meant to shake Arjuna out of his deluded state of mind. They were intended to inform Arjuna that his assessment of this situation, and his plan of exiting from the situation, were totally incorrect and invalid.   Moreover, rule number one in communication skills training is \u201ctailor the message to the audience\u201d. We see that here. Arjuna is a tough warrior, and tough talk is the only language he understands. An analogy would be a coach providing directions to a player in the middle of a football game. He would use tough talk, not sympathetic talk.   Shri Krishna also highlights another point here, that the timing of Arjuna\u2019s fall into sorrow is not appropriate. If he did want to express any emotion towards his kinsmen, he had a lot of time to do so prior to the battle. Once in battle, this behaviour was unwarranted.   Footnotes   1. In the rest of the Gita, Shri Krishna is addressed as \u201cBhagavaan\u201d. Bhagavaan means the one who is endowed with \u201cbhagas\u201d or divine attributes: wealth, virtue, glory, might, knowledge and dispassion.   2. The second verse is one long word composed of several shorter words. In Sanskrit, words are joined together using a system of rules called \u201csandhi\u201d. It is not necessary to learn the sandhi rules since most commentaries dissect long words into their components. We are fortunate to leverage their efforts here."

The poetic phrase \u201cconfused eyes\u201d probably alludes to Arjuna not being able to see right from wrong i.e. his viveka was suppressed.   Moreover, this state has affected Arjuna\u2019s entire personality \u2013 physically because he had tears, emotionally because he was struck with grief and pity, and intellectually because he was confused about what to do and what not to do.   Shri Krishna is referred again here as Madhusoodana. This name can be interpreted a couple of ways. In the Puraanas, Lord Vishnu assumed the form of Hayagriva to kill the demon Madhu, hence he is known as Madhusoodana. This means that Sanjaya, through his divine vision, knew that Shri Krishna was connected to Lord Vishnu. Another interpretation of the name Madhusoodana is one who slays honey. Honey is a metaphor for the ego, which can be extremely sweet for someone who does not know all the nefarious things that it is capable of."

        "content": "We are about to begin our journey into the second chapter of the Gita. Let us take this opportunity to orient ourselves, so that we can get the most out of our journey.        The second chapter is an extremely important chapter, perhaps the most important chapter of the Gita. It is long and contains most of the oft-quotes verses of the Gita. It also introduces most of the key themes of the Gita at a high level. The rest of the Gita picks up these themes and elaborates on them. Therefore there is a variety of topics that we shall get to see in the second chapter.        Looking back at the first chapter, we can see that it covered topics that any person could easily identify with. The second chapter will be different in this respect. It will tackle a mix of the practical as well as the spiritual, because the Gita treats both aspects as integral to living life correctly.        The second chapter will also introduce abstract concepts that may initially seem unfamiliar and hard to understand. The attitude here should be like the person who is visiting a prominent art gallery for the first time. You will see landscapes as well as modern art. The first time you come across modern art you may not understand it, but slowly through exposure and repetition, you begin to appreciate its nuances.         We will begin chapter 2 where chapter 1 left us, in the battlefield, where Arjuna had discarded his weapons."

        "content": "The message of the first chapter of the Gita is this: The root cause of all sorrow and suffering in this world is our inability to deal with conflict.   That is why the Gita was taught to Arjuna in the middle of a gruesome battlefield, with swords clanging, trumpets roaring and soldiers screaming. Conflict is everywhere, and we have to learn to handle it. The sooner we recognize this universal truth about conflict and its impact, the sooner we can progress in our personal, professional, and ultimately, spiritual journeys.   We experience conflict at three levels \u2013 material, mental and spiritual. At the material level, conflict is everywhere. Atoms collide against atoms. Weeds take over carefully manicured flowers. Packs of wolves fight for control of territory. And we humans have disagreements with children, siblings, spouses, bosses, co-workers, states and countries. To deal with conflict at the material level, we need to learn how to act, and what to say, in any situation.   Now, here\u2019s the second kind of conflict. How we conduct ourselves in material conflict is largely dependent on the state of our minds. Our minds are always in conflict, primarily between our rational side and our ego. Our primal urges constitute the ego, the part of our mind that oversimplifies and exaggerates situations, and responds to every situation with a \u201cfight or flight\u201d reaction, and shuts off the rational part of our mind that can think logically and clearly.   And even when our rational mind is active, we are unable to make the right decision because we cannot resolve conflicting arguments. We are always talking to ourselves in our head. \u201cI should buy this shirt\u201d. \u201cNo wait, that shirt looks better\u201d. \u201cBut this one is on sale\u201d.   Back to Arjuna\u2019s dilemma. When confronting the material conflict of battle, Arjuna\u2019s rational mind was clear \u2013 he was a warrior, and he had entered the battlefield to fight a war against the enemy for a just cause. But, upon seeing his family on the enemy side, his rational mind became conflicted. Should I kill my family? Or should I perform my duty?   Eventually his ego \u2013 the primitive side of his mind \u2013 took control away from his rational mind.         It went into \u201cflight\u201d mode. It made him say, it is better to run away and become a monk, than to perform my duty. The inability to reconcile this conflict in his mind led to his mental breakdown in the middle of the battlefield. He could not commit        to fighting, and being unable to decide, he wanted to quit.   So then, conflict at the material level, and at the mental level, is pervasive. It is an integral part of life. We cannot escape it. But so what? Shouldn\u2019t we just accept this state of affairs?   What\u2019s unique about the Gita is its perspective on how we should deal these two levels of conflict. The clue lies in verses 21 and 22, where Shri Krishna positions Arjuna literally in the middle of the two armies, a point from which Arjuna can see his dearest teachers and relatives stationed on the other side of the battlefield. This immediately triggers the third type of conflict \u2013 not material, not mental, but that of identity.   Arjuna now thinks: Who am I? Am I the warrior fighting for a just cause? Or am I the beloved student of my teacher? If I am that warrior, I should be in the Pandava army. If I am that beloved student and relative, I should be in the Kaurava army. But I am both. I am all of these roles, and many more. So what should I do? Since I don\u2019t know how to reconcile my identity, let me quit \u2013 it is the easiest option I have.   Quitting is the default response of the ego. In his speech to Shri Krishna, Arjuna used logic to justify his quitting the battle. This is what many of us to \u2013 we run away from our conflicts, and use logic, or even God or religion \u2013 a whole host of rationalizations \u2013 to justify our quitting to ourselves, and to others. (Here, we use the word \u201cGod\u201d to refer to the invisible random forces that drive the world, including chance, luck, destiny, fate, evolution and so on.)   This confusion of identity is the third type of conflict, the spiritual conflict. Unless we know who we are, what God is, and what our connection to that God is, we will never be able to completely resolve all of our material and mental conflicts. This is the central theme of the first chapter.   The second chapter contains Shri Krishna\u2019s response to Arjuna\u2019s misguided speech, and a summary of the entire Gita. It addresses how to deal with all three types of conflicts, so that we can put an end to sorrow and anxiety at their root."

His body language reflects his state of mind as he threw away his weapons and sat down on his chariot, in the midst of the battlefield. Sanjay the narrator took over here, and possibly gave a glimmer of hope to Dhritraashtra, who was hoping that this action of Arjuna could end the war even before it began.        Let us reflect upon the first chapter of the Bhagavad Gita, in preparation for the second chapter. Arjuna, ready for war, under the influence of his ego and mind, became weak when Shri Krishna moved the chariot in between the Paandava and Kaurava armies.        Now, we may never face a war in our lifetime, but we will undoubtedly face conflicts in life where we lose our mental equipoise, and need guidance on what the right course of action is. Death of a loved one, hard economic conditions, issues with family members or friends, a bad boss, a stressful job \u2013 life is full of conflict-ridden situations.        This chapter is called \u201cArjuna Vishaada Yoga\u201d, or the Yoga of Arjuna\u2019s dejection. We will delve deeper into the meaning of the word Yoga later, but for now, let\u2019s assume that it means technique or method that shows how one should conduct oneself in a life situation.        So why is Arjuna\u2019s dejection called a technique or a method? Let\u2019s take an example. Assume you own a car, and ever since you owned the car for about 10 years or so. You have never had an accident, and you never had the need to get a car insurance policy. But one fine day, you drive into your neighbour\u2019s car, and end up owing him a gigantic sum of money. From that day onwards, you will never ever drive a car without insurance. So, what this means is that you had to pass through an extremely difficult situation in order to gain the knowledge that insurance is important.        Similarly, Arjuna had to pass through an extremely difficult life situation which jolted him so much that it made him realize that he was missing something essential. He did not know how to conduct himself in such a difficult situation. Fortunately for him, Shri Krishna was right there to provide him that instruction. But without passing through that tough life situation, he never would have realized the need for such an instruction. Therefore, just like any other chapter in the Gita, this chapter is also a Yoga, or a method, of how to conduct one\u2019s life correctly.        om tatsatiti shreematbhagavatgitasupanishadsu brahmavidyaayaam  yogashaastre shreekrishnaarjunsamvade arjunavishaadayogo naama  prathamodhyaayaha || 1 ||"

It shows the extent of delusion in Arjuna\u2019s mind, as he morphed from a mighty warrior into a pathetic, weak, helpless individual. Arjuna was desperately looking to escape the difficult situation he found himself in, and so his mind came up with all kinds of arguments to justify this escape, including making the escape \u201cbeneficial\u201d.        Let us revisit our friend Mr. X. He has been laid off due to the recession, and has been out of work for 3 months. He has not interviewed in over 2 weeks now. As time goes by, his confidence begins to weaken. If his mind cannot maintain equanimity, it will lead him down a path similar to Arjuna\u2019s fall. He begins to think that there\u2019s no point in applying for more jobs since there aren\u2019t any, and even if he gets an interview call, he has to compete with more qualified candidates. Therefore, there\u2019s no point even trying. In fact, it\u2019s better to stay at home and do nothing because there\u2019s no point applying for a job in a bad economy. Just look at how his mind has generated perverse logic to preserve the ego.        There\u2019s another point to note here : Shri Krishna kept quiet throughout Arjuna\u2019s rant. He wanted Arjuna to expel every perverse argument out of his system, in preparation for the teaching of the Gita."

According to him, a rise in lawlessness began a chain reaction which caused the entire civilization, not just the warmongers, to end up residing in hell indefinitely.        Let\u2019s summarize this argument. What Arjuna is saying, in simple words, is that the Kaurava army is committing the sin of destroying the Kuru clan. Since he can see that it is a sin, he will not join them in this act, and therefore not fight.        Again, we see moha at work here. Duryodhana had moha for the Kauravas, whereas Arjuna had moha for the entire Kuru dynasty. Even though Arjuna was more large-hearted than Duryodhana in his moha, moha clouded his judgement the same way it clouded Duryodhana\u2019s judgement.        Moreover, in verse 45, Arjuna\u2019s demonstrates classic \u201cvictim\u201d mindset where one cannot see oneself in control of a situation, by using words such as \u201calas\u201d, \u201cit is unfortunate\u201d. His moha took over his mind so completely that one of the world\u2019s foremost warriors spoke words that a weakling would use."

It is not that difficult to draw a parallel between the reverence for the ancestors of a society expressed here, and the reverence for the builders of any institution in the modern world.

He echoes a fear that most warriors have in the back of the mind when they go to war. Invading armies seldom show respect and dignity to the women of the defeated kingdom, they are usually treated as the spoils of the war. History has proven this out, and unfortunately it is still the case wherever there is the aftermath of war.        In any society, due to the law of averages, there always will be a part of the population with questionable morals and character. However, in a post-war situation where women are treated without dignity, and have to succumb to their invaders, there is no guarantee that they will be able to raise their children with the right values, education and morals. This results in a breakdown in character in the younger generation across the board. Arjuna downward-spiraling mind feared this scenario.        Footnotes1.

One traditional meaning of the word \u201cvarna\u201d is caste, and if this meaning is taken, the second verse means \u201cthis gives rise to contamination of castes\u201d.

He wanted to point out that his moral judgement was superior relative to the opposing army\u2019s position. This current sequence of verses is a classic example of how a seemingly logical argument is completely illogical because it has sprung from erroneous foundations. Moreover, Arjuna echoes the human tendency to point out flaws in others when the flaw lies in the pointer.        Illogical as it may be, Arjuna\u2019s comment lets us explore a force similar to moha, that of \u201clobha\u201d or the desire to accumulate something. An increase in lobha for an object, person, situation or circumstance tends to suppress our viveka, our discerning ability. A politician that has extreme greed for a ministerial position could resort to illegal and unethical means to get it. Recent events in global financial markets are a good example where bankers were willing to defraud investors by selling them subprime loans, simply due to greed.        Both moha and lobha have one thing in common, they seemingly result in pleasure. Foe example, in case of moha, extreme attachment one\u2019s son or one\u2019s spouse gives one pleasure. In case of lobha, the desire to accumulate wealth or power gives one pleasure. But in both cases, the pleasure that one obtains is temporary and fleeting. In addition, one tends to cling to the object gained by lobha or moha for fear of losing it.        So what attitude should we have towards people or things we care about? The Gita delves into this topic in great detail."

Here, Arjuna concluded his argument to Shri Krishna in which he asserted that that he did not want to fight. To defend that argument, Arjuna provided several points: that there was no point in the war or even in living itself, that the very people that he was fighting against were the same people that made him happy, that killing his kinsmen and his well-wishers was a sin, and that there would be no joy derived in doing so.        This argument was not built on any sort of rationality or logic because Arjuna came under the influence of \u201cmoha\u201d or delusion, the delusion that personal relationships were more important in the battlefield than one\u2019s duty. An increase in moha usually suppresses our ability to discern between what is correct and what is not. This discerning ability is called \u201cviveka\u201d.        Here\u2019s an real world example that illustrates moha and viveka. Imagine that your brother has a drinking problem, and needs to hear from you that the addiction needs to stop. What is the right thing for you to do? It is a difficult situation because your moha and viveka come into conflict. Viveka tells you that the right thing for you to do is to intervene, but moha tells you that doing so will endanger your relationship.        Another common example is that a surgeon will usually not perform an operation on a relative exactly because of this moha.         Footnotes1. Viveka is the first step in the \u201cSaadhana Chatushthaya\u201d, the 4-fold qualifications that are required for anyone treading on the spiritual path. Barring a few exceptions if you do not cultivate the ability to discern what is correct and what is not, your spiritual journey will never commence."

Which law did Arjuna use to come to the conclusion that his was about to commit a sin?        If Shri Krishna agreed that Arjuna\u2019s act was a sin, he would have said something. But as we see, Shri Krishna did not say anything even after hearing this statement.        All this boils down to a simple point: when faced with a situation in life, how should we act?

But why was he repeating his arguments? Note that in each verse, he addressed Shri Krishna directly, hoping to get some sort of support or endorsement from him. But, Shri Krishna did not say one word, since he wanted to wait till Arjuna\u2019s delusionary outburst ended.        In the second verse about not desiring victory in the three worlds, Arjuna tried to justify his retreat from fighting by wrapping his cowardice in a cloak of fake large-heartedness. The ego can sometimes be more cunning than any politician."

Either insomnia, especially waking in the early hours of the morning, or oversleeping (also known as hypersomnia).5) Anger or irritability. Feeling agitated, restless, or even violent. Your tolerance level is low, your temper short, and everything and everyone gets on your nerves.6) Loss of energy. Feeling fatigued, sluggish, and physically drained. Your whole body may feel heavy, and even small tasks are exhausting or take longer to complete.7) Self-loathing. Strong feelings of worthlessness or guilt. You harshly criticize yourself for perceived faults and mistakes.8) Reckless behavior. You engage in escapist behavior such as substance abuse, compulsive gambling, reckless driving, or dangerous sports.9) Concentration problems. Trouble focusing, making decisions, or remembering things.10)Unexplained aches and pains. An increase in physical complaints such as headaches, back pain, aching muscles, and stomach pain.        Arjuna was suffering from most of the symptoms from this list. He now was mired in deep, almost suicidal depression, especially because he was questioning the value of life itself."

On the surface, one would attribute Arjuna\u2019s second statement in this verse to an outpouring of compassion towards his kinsmen. But, would an outpouring of compassion cause a panic attack? The true underlying emotion that caused the panic attack was fear. And what was Arjuna afraid of? Arjuna was accustomed to winning every war that he fought. When he saw the caliber of warriors in the Kaurava army, his ego felt extremely threatened that maybe this time it won\u2019t win. Here we see that Arjuna\u2019s ego was trying to deflect this fear by substituting compassion for the true emotion of fear."

In these verses, Arjuna described his symptoms to Shri Krishna, beginning first with his physical symptoms and in later verses, his mental and emotional symptoms.        It is rare that one gets to see a blow-by-blow account of a nervous breakdown in a spiritual text. But as we have seen, the Gita is not just a spiritual text but also an extremely practical text.         The rest of the chapter will look at what statements Arjuna or any individual will make when undergoing a highly disturbed emotional state. Many commentaries do not give importance to these verses. However, I think they are instructive for a variety of reasons, the primary one being that when we undergo such disturbed emotional states, we lose the objectivity to see clearly what is happening to us and perhaps stay alert for such symptoms."

Like bipolar person, a strong ego can go from one emotion to its exact opposite almost instantly. When Arjuna saw the caliber of warriors in the opposing army, his demeanour switched from courage to cowardice in a matter of seconds.        Why did this happen? When one is under the control of the ego rather than the rational intellect, one\u2019s emotional balance is extremely vulnerable. All it took to destabilize his balance was for Shri Krishna to highlight Arjuna\u2019s kinsmen in the army.         This verse also shows that no one is immune from the workings of the ego. Arjuna was a well-educated, committed warrior, in fact one of the best warriors on the planet. Even someone as tough as him lost his emotional balance so quickly.        Footnotes1. An interesting simile is provided in the Jnyaneshwari for this verse. Just like a man forgets his old girlfriend after being infatuated with a new girl, Arjuna\u2019s warrior instincts were replaced with pity for his kinsmen, and cowardice for the war."

Soon, he began to see familiar faces in both the Kaurava and Paandava armies.        This experience is not so far away from the real world. In fact, a similar situation could have been faced by soldiers in the India Pakistan war, where many soldiers may have had to fight their friends and relatives. Even if we never have to wage war, we may have faced a similar situation.        Imagine you are a student who is about to graduate from college.

But he chose an interesting location, he positioned it right where Arjuna could see his fondest relatives, friends and well wishers on the Kaurava side. So now, Arjuna was face to face with the people he had love and respect for, including Bheeshma and Drona.        This verse contains the first words spoked by Shri Krishna in the Gita, and reflect his wise and clever personality. Instead of referring to the Kauravas as \u201csons of Dhritraashtra\u201d as Arjuna and Sanjaya did, he refers to them as \u201cKurus\u201d. This was an interesting choice, because both Kauravas and Paandavas are part of the Kuru dynasty. So Shri Krishna was pointing out the similarity between the two armies rather than their differences.        In addition, Shri Krishna wanted to use this opportunity to create the conditions in which he would deliver the teaching of the Gita. He knew that Arjuna\u2019s puffed up ego and battle spirit would be challenged by bringing him face to face with warriors like Bheeshma and Drona, who were not just mighty and powerful, but were also people he cared a lot about."

Similar to the analysis of Duryodhana\u2019s emotional state from the previous verses, let us analyze Arjuna\u2019s state. Here, it is clear that he was charged up for war, his warrior instincts had kicked into high gear, and he was bursting with self-confidence.        Another point to consider here is how much, like Arjuna, we rely on our sense organs to deliver the right information to our brain so that we can take the right decision and carry out the necessary action that a situation demands. Our sense organs comprise our eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin. Any information that we process must necessarily come from one of these organs. Arjuna was located at some distance from the opposing army, so he knew that he needed to get a better look at the opposing army, and therefore have all the information he needs to make his battle plans.        Sense organs and understanding how they function is a topic that will be discussed at great length in the rest of the Gita."

Let\u2019s also look at another aspect that this shloka highlights. The core of the Gita is a dialogue between Shri Krishna and Arjuna. In ancient Indian literature, there exists a tradition of beginning important teachings or messages with the word \u201catha\u201d which means now. The shlokas so far covered introduction and background, but now, Arjuna starts the dialogue in the next verse, hence the word \u201catha\u201d is used here.                Footnotes1. The meter followed in the Gita is called \u201cAnushtup Chhanda\u201d2. Each chapter of the Gita concludes with a sentence that acts as a marker signifying the end of the chapter. These traditions were followed as a means to make memorization easier, among other things. Every end-of-chapter market contains the phrase \u201cShri-Krishna-Arjuna-Samvade\u201d which means \u201ca dialogue between Shri Krishna and Arjuna\u201d"

Similarly, when the Pandavas blew their conches, their sound was much louder and spirited than the Kauravas, even though the Pandava army was a fraction of the Kaurava army.

We should remind ourselves again and again that the Gita is first and foremost a practical text on how to lead a balanced life, a life that is in harmony with the world. Therefore, we should try to connect what we read in this text to our own life and experiences.         Arjuna was face to face with the Kaurava army, and the sound of the conches indicated that he was about to deal with an extremely difficult situation \u2013 that of war. Most of us also have to deal with extremely difficult situations every day, though usually not that of life or death, but ones with high stakes nevertheless. If you are a student, then a tough exam is an example. If you have a job, then a upcoming meeting with your boss is is another example.         When I read the blowing of the conches, I recalled a sound from my childhood which for me had similar implications. Early in the morning, at the same time everyday, I would hear the sound of a air raid warning alarm, coming in from the distance. There was no imminent threat of an air raid, that sound was used only to test the warning system. But for me personally, it reminded me that in a few minutes I would have to face the most difficult situation a shy, nerdy kid has to face everyday \u2013 school!         Footnotes        1.

Shri Krishna was a close friend of Arjuna, and offered to be his charioteer for the Mahabharata         war.        The prior verses served to paint a picture of the Kaurava army, that was ready to engage in conflict with the Pandavas. As we move further into the text, the perspective shifts from Duryodhana\u2019s viewpoint to Arjuna\u2019s.        Footnotes1. Many commentaries offer a lot of background from the Mahabharata in order to describe the grandeur of Arjuna\u2019s chariot. It was a robust chariot, endowed with several divine powers. A key feature of the chariot was a flag in which Lord Hanumaan had entered in the form of an emblem. Therefore it is said that Lord Hanumaan was one of the few individuals to hear the Gita firsthand."

As we progress through this verse into some of the later verses, we cannot help but paint a picture of that battlefield, since the words used in these verses are so evocative. For some of us that grew up in India, we probably tend to dig up memories of watching the Mahabharata on Sunday morning, and maybe those memories are recalled. With this verse, we now have another dimension that adds depth to the picture \u2013 that of sound.        The author of these verses clearly intends to paint a rich picture of the battlefield, and the Kaurava army in particular. We shall see why shortly."

Note that Drona did not reply to any of Duryodhana\u2019s statements at any point in the conversation. His silence indicated either anger, disappointment or knowing the inevitable that his army was doomed to failure.   If you measure Duryodhana\u2019s comments, they tend to become increasingly arrogant and hyperbolic throughout the conversation. Anytime you have somebody making hyperbolic statements praising themselves, it usually indicates an underlying insecurity.   Footnote   1. In translating this verse I looked up several commentaries, and this is the first verse where I have encountered a difference in translation. Some commentators translate the Sanskrit word \u201caparyaptam\u201d to mean \u201cbeyond sufficient\u201d or \u201cinfinitely capable\u201d. This is the meaning that I have used above. However, some commentators translate it as \u201cless than sufficient\u201d or \u201climited capability\u201d.

In doing so, his ego resurfaced again, which is evidenced by his self-aggrandizing statements like \u201cthey will give up their life for me\u201d. He probably was trying to convince (or delude) himself that his army is poised to win the battle.   The tendency of the ego to consider something \u201cmine\u201d is called mamataa in Sanskrit. Mamataa literally means \u201cmine-making\u201d or \u201cmine-ness\u201d. This is yet another means for the ego to strengthen itself through possessions.   Here\u2019s an interesting exercise. Take something that you know for sure is \u201cyours\u201d. Now deeply examine it. Is it really yours? For example, say you own a house. On what basis do you consider it yours? Most probably, it\u2019s a legal document that the government issues to you. Well, what happens if that government no longer exists? Or, more likely, what happens if the government grabs that land from you because it possesses some precious natural resources? Is the relationship between you and the house \u201creal\u201d?

Throughout the last few verses we were observing Duryodhana\u2019s emotional state. After having lobbed an insult at Drona, and not having heard a response back, Duryodhana now became scared that he had angered his army\u2019s main commander and his teacher. So he wanted to say something to appease Drona. Hence he began his assessment of powerful warriors by putting Drona first in this verse.   What does this tell us about Duryodhana\u2019s personality? Sometimes we tend to view people as either good or evil, and by that logic Duryodhana would be considered evil. But this temporary outpouring of reverence for his teacher shows that Duryodhana had some good qualities in him, although in lower proportion to his bad qualities.   Later the Gita will provide a detailed explanation of types of qualities that all individuals have. At this point, let us consider that all individuals have a mix of three qualities or tendencies: a tendency that draws us towards inertia, another that draws us to action, and another that draws us to equanimity or harmony. Usually, one or two tendencies tend to dominate the other in us.   You may know some people who have a tendency to be lazy and sleep all the time. Or there may be someone who cannot rest and has to keep doing something or the other. Or, there are some who do what\u2019s needed to run their lives and are not lazy, and also deal with severe setbacks and challgenges while managing to stay calm, collected and even-keel.   What do we think is our most dominant tendency? Are there external factors that change it temporarily? For example, if you find that your most dominant tendency is towards action, are there factors that make you stable and peaceful?"

As is apparent from the text of the verse, he wanted to now talk to Drona about his army, having assessed the capabilities of the Pandava army.   Notice how each verse gives an indication of Duryodhana\u2019s state of mind. Initially, he saw the well-formed army of the Pandavas that was marching with a single vision, and began to worry that it may prove to be a formidable opponent. His worry prompted him to instigate Drona. Now in this verse Duryodhana\u2019s worry unleashed a condescending, mean attitude by calling Drona a \u201ctwice born\u201d.   Twice-born usually refers to individuals in the brahman, kshatriya and vaishya classes. However, in this verse, this was a veiled insult because although Drona was a accomplished warrior, he was a brahmin by birth. Duryodhana wanted to imply that Drona, being a brahmin, would be soft on his disciples the Pandavas.        In addition, use of the phrase \u201cmy army\u201d also indicates that Duryodhana\u2019s ego was puffed up at this point.   Negative emotions like fear and worry, when allowed to simmer in the mind, tend to unleash the worst in us. Later, the Gita will go in great detail into how this happens.   Footnotes   1.

He chose each name carefully to elicit a reaction from Drona, since each of these warriors had a history with Drona.   Yuyudhaana was Arjuna\u2019s top student, and Duryodhana wanted to point out that although Arjuna\u2019s top student was fighting on his teacher\u2019s side, Drona\u2019s top student Arjuna was fighting against his teacher. Drupada also was someone that Drona disliked, as was pointed out earlier. Dhristaketu\u2019s father had been killed by Krishna, yet he was on the side of the Pandavas. Chekitaana was the only Yadava warrior not taking the side of the Kauravas.   The king of Kashi was an exceptionally gallant warrior, and took the side of the Pandavas. Yudhamanyu and Uttamauja were exceptional warriors from the Paanchaala kingdom. Purujit and Kuntibhoja were Kunti\u2019s maternal brothers who were also related to the Kauravas, but chose the side of the Pandavas. Shaibya was Yudhishtira\u2019s father-in-law, similarly related to the Kauravas. Abhimanyu, Arjuna\u2019s son, was well versed in the art of breaking military formations. Duryodhana disliked Draupadi immensely, so her sons were pointed out as well.   We begin to see how interrelated the warring parties were. Some were friends who turned into enemies, some were relatives who chose sides, and some like Drona were equally loving to both sides, but had to choose one based on their duty to the throne and the kingdom.   It is a reminder that nothing in our lives stays the same. A relationship that gives you lot of joy today, could in a matter of seconds turn into a sorrowful relationship at some point."

In the first two verses, Sanjaya and Dhritrashtra were talking, and in this verse, Duryodhana is addressing his teacher Drona.   Here we begin to explore another theme of the Gita which is that of mental equanimity, or as sometimes it is referred to, \u201ceven keelness\u201d. We are at our best when our mind, the part of our brain that feels emotions, is calm and not agitated. When our mind is calm it enables our intellect, the part of our brain that evaluates options and makes rational decisions, to give us the most logical way out of a situation. In the TV show \u201cStar Trek\u201d, Mr. Spock was always consulted to provide the best decision because he would never take emotions into considerations when making a decision.   In the last verse we saw that Duryodhana wanted to ensure that Drona was sufficiently motivated to fight against his students the Pandavas, lest he become weak due to having a soft spot for them. So Duryodhana attempted to disturb Drona\u2019s equanimity by reminding him that the leader of the military formation that is in front of them is the son of Drupada.   Drupada and Drona had a chequered past. They were the best of friends, but due to some misunderstandings, they turned into sworn enemies. By reminding Drona that Drupada\u2019s son Dhrishtadyunma is leading the opposing army, Duryodhana wanted to stir up Drona\u2019s emotions so that he think that his students purposely put Dhrushtadyumna in front, just to spite Drona.   Do we have such biases or filters in our lives through which we view people or situations? How were they formed? Did some Duryodhana plant them in us? Uncovering such biases makes our decision-making clearer and simpler."

Duryodhana was the son of Dhritrashtra, and leader of the Kaurava army in the Mahabharata war. He was a skilled and strong warrior, almost equal in prowess to Bhima, the strongest warrior in the Pandava army.   Since childhood, Duryodhana grew up with the idea that he was the rightful heir to the throne and not Yudhishtira, who was the eldest brother of the Pandavas. Going back to the theme of the previous verse which is that of attachment, he was extremely attached to the throne. But because he perceived the Pandavas as an obstacle to the throne, which was something that he was extremely attached to, he developed an aversion towards them.   Think of aversion or in other words, hatred, as the polar opposite of attachment. But interestingly enough, it is born out of attachment itself. For example, we saw that Mr. X from the last post was extremely attached to his car, and saw that someone had made a large dent in it. What feeling do you think Mr. X had for the person who caused that dent? That is aversion. Aversion is usually caused when we perceive a person, situation or object as an obstacle between us and the object of our attachment. And aversion, just like attachment, strengthens the ego. Examples are people (I hate my boss), objects (I hate my old TV), positions (I hate anyone who believes in communism) or situations (I hate my job).   Now, why did Duryodhana approach his teacher Drona? He saw the military formation of the Pandavas and began to get scared. As is the case, most people run to someone superior when they get scared, so he approached his teacher for counsel.   Drona was a teacher to both the Pandavas and Kauravas, and had equal affinity to both of them. And unlike some of the other senior warriors, Drona was not a blood relation to the Kauravas. Duryodhana also sensed that he needs to check in with Drona to understand his state of mind, because he needed Drona\u2019s prowess to win this war.   There is an interesting leadership lesson here. If you are leading a team \u2013 in a business, political or any context \u2013 your success is not guaranteed unless everyone buys into a common vision that you as a leader have articulated.   Footnotes   1. There is a redundancy here in the phrase \u201cvachanambraveet\u201d. Usually if you write \u201csay\u201d, most people know that you mean \u201csay words\u201d. But here the word \u201cabraveet\u201d is used in addition to \u201cvachana\u201d. This could mean that the words that Duryodhana is going to speak in the next verse are not ordinary words, they could perhaps be very negative or hurtful.   2. Sanjay uses the word \u201craaja\u201d or king when referring to Duryodhana. Perhaps he is hinting here that the root cause of this war is over the question of who the legitimate king is."

So begins the first chapter of the Gita. The first chapter is a dialog between Dhritrashtra, father of the Kauravas and Sanjaya, his charioteer and also his adviser. Sanjaya was given divine vision so that he could provide a real-time commentary on the Mahabharata war for the sightless Dhritrashtra.   This verse begins to reveal one of the recurring themes of the Gita \u2013 the downside of extreme attachment to objects or situations. Dhritrashtra means someone who clings to his kingdom, and Sanjaya means victory. Dhritrashtra was extremely attached to his sons and his kingdom, which is one of the reasons that the Mahabharata war occurred. He refers to his nephews as \u201cPandu\u2019s sons\u201d indicating that they are a 3rd party, whereas his sons are referred to as \u201cmy sons\u201d.   What exactly is attachment? Here\u2019s an example. Let\u2019s say Mr. X brought a brand new car. He shows it to all his friends, they ooh and they aah, his spouse is happy, his kids are jumping up and down and so on. When he hears all the praises, there usually is something inside him that \u201cpuffs up\u201d. That thing is the ego. Now let\u2019s say a few weeks have passed. It\u2019s morning and as he opens the car door, he notices a large dent on the side of the car. He begins to experience anger, sadness, and a whole host of other emotions.   What just happened? It was attachment to the car. Mr. X\u2019s ego created an identification with the new car. In other words, it began to think of the car as an extension of its identity. So any praise for the car became the ego\u2019s praise, and any harm to the car became the ego\u2019s harm. The ego strengthens itself by attachment, i.e. identification with objects, thoughts (I am smart, I am sincere etc), positions (e.g. right wing vs left wing).   So what is the practical lesson here? Later chapters and verses will go in detail into this subject, but till then, this verse urges us to examine our life and take stock of our attachments. What are our attachments? How strong are those attachments? What can we do to prevent ourselves getting entangled in more and more attachments?   Also \u2013 at this point, do we think that all attachments are bad? Or are some good? Upon introspection we will find the answers.The Gita will begin to address those questions as we go further into it.   Footnotes   1. Eckhart Tolle talks about ego and attachment in his books \u201cThe Power Of Now\u201d and \u201cA New Earth\u201d   2. Per the Dnyaneshwari commentary, the word \u201cdharmakshetre\u201d here suggests that Kurukshetra battleground had a positive energy that was known to bring senseless warriors to their senses and make them behave rationally. Perhaps Dhritrashtra wanted to know whether that positive energy compelled his sons the Kauravas to give up the idea of war altogether."

As I watched that program, I realized that there is something here that is attracting me, but I could not quite explain why. I tried to watch that program as often as possible during my 3 month stay in India.        When I returned to the US to continue my work, those Gita discourses stuck in my head. I began to buy commentaries on the Gita from several authors, and eventually came across a teacher whose audio discourses resonated with me. Now I am looking at the end of the 18th chapter (the last chapter) of the Gita, and having gone through it over the course of 2 years, still feel a need to understand it deeply.        This blog is my attempt to restart my journey of the Gita, beginning with the first verse of chapter 1. But this time, I want to go deeper and understand each verse to the best of my ability.
